955446,4964072,2013-06-04,4463758,Jason,"Everything was exactly like the pictures.  Great place, great locations.  Rogers Center, CN Tower, Wayne Gretzky's, Starbucks, Convenience Store, Dry-cleaners, are all close by.  His place had all the necessities.

I would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to Toronto.  The price was very reasonable.  Sam was responsive upon my arrival and helped me with any issues I had.

Great place!

955446,5780138,2013-07-16,1783112,Carolyn,"The place was super clean and tastefully decorated. Everything we needed was available, down to the details like laundry soap, and nice extras like coffee and sugar.  Sam always got back to us quickly and was so helpful.  Wonderful convenient location!
We will definitely stay there again next summer!
Thanks,
Carolyn"
955446,5898696,2013-07-21,6714903,Cyndi,"Sam's condo was perfect and Sam was a pleasure to work with.  He always responded super fast, was flexible and always very positive.  The condo itself is in a great location- steps away from King Street, The CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Second City, the TTC and more.  It is a comfy home away from home stocked with all the important and little things you want and need.  From super comfy sheets to a well equipped kitchen and of course wifi- I would highly recommend the condo.    The building is modern, has 24 hour security, parking underground, an indoor pool and recreation area, and a rooftop patio with grills available.  I will definitely stay here again."
955446,6029317,2013-07-27,1804358,Gwendolyn (Wendy),"The apartment was as described and pictured, although we were a bit surprised to find that the living room overlooked a power station across the street.  The apartment was very clean, but we were only left with 2 sets of towels for the 4 of us....luckily we were able to get two more from a storage cabinet without too much hassle.  We did have a challenge figuring out the parking situation.  It took us a while to find the entry door for the underground garage and then we had to figure out how to get someone to open it for us.  Luckily, the guards at the ground floor entry were able to help us.  The garage itself requires very tight turning as you go down 4 levels to the parking spot (we had a minivan, so this was a bit challenging).  Our next challenge (since we hadn't yet picked up the keys) was getting out of the garage.  We found out that the elevator access requires the key fob which we did not have yet and the parking space is 4 levels below ground and all stairwells have door that lock behind you when you enter them.  We ended up pulling our luggage up the parking garage until we found someone who was able to let us into the elevator bay which got us to the apartment building lobby so that we could finally pick up the keys/key fob.  In terms of getting around Toronto, we were able to walk to almost everything and found the Queen Street street car very easy to use when we went to the Beaches Jazz Festival.  The streets around the apartment felt very safe even when arriving back late at night.  All in all, we enjoyed our stay, but would have appreciated getting clearer instructions about arriving/key pickup/parking.  "
955446,6407802,2013-08-11,9980,Barb,Location. Location. Location! Sam's apartment was just what my 2 friends and I needed for our first visit to Toronto.  We were very comfortable in the unit.  The kitchen had everything we needed. Figuring out the tv was a challenge. It should have a manual. The bed in the bedroom was really comfortable. There were so many bars and restaurants in walking distance. We always felt safe walking the streets. The CN Tower is 2 blocks away and the hop on sightseeing bus was great!  Second City was steps away from the back entrance. We had a great time in Toronto!

955446,12495656,2014-05-04,11725852,Junhong,"Having lived in downtown Toronto for 5 months as a student, I can definitely say that Sam's apartment is in an extremely good location. Most of the places of interests and attractions (CN tower, Rogers Centre, Eaton Centre) are within 10-15 minutes walking time. It is very easy to go to the entertainment district and the spadina chinatown. Any further and you might wanna take the subway which is a mere 5 minutes away on foot. 

The Condominium and apartment itself feels almost brand new. I would say that it can comfortably accomodate 5-6 people. Almost everything you need is provided for (towels, fresh sheets, kitchen utensils, washer + dryer). We even used the kitchen to prepare a few meals during our stay. The Futon bed looks small in the photo but was surprisingly spacious and sleeps 2 comfortably. 

Overall, this is the best airbnb apartment i've stayed in and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for value-for-money accomodation in downtown Toronto.
"
955446,12678152,2014-05-07,13719869,Abdullah,"The place is beautiful and its location is perfect. Everything is near. The kitchen is fully equipped and nice. We had a place to park our car so it was very convenient.

A bit expensive though!"
955446,15023635,2014-07-01,10385306,Faisal,"The cono was very commfortable and well equiped for long/sort term visitors, everything is around, reachable, accesable comfortably.

Sam was helpull and good person who would like to help in good and not costing both of us.

In addition Sam""s responses were received in very short time (emails, SMS or even via Whats app).


The only one thing that I wasn't convenient with is the cleaning cost is much greater than the housemade outcomes!! especially the balcony was dusty and well cleaned and she refused to clean it because it is out of her scope of work, in addition she didn't cleaned (take out the water from the fridge that produced due to the humidity of it and there is not external drainage to drop out the water drops).

All on all everything  was good, and you'll feel you are in the heart of Toronto (near to blue Jays stadium, Rogers, CN tower, ...........) while you are sitting in the balcony.

The building was secured 24 hrs, and your parking is the same, the internet was fast and available 24hrs/day.

955446,19404281,2014-09-12,1669751,Eloisa,"Sam was a great host, all was as we agreed and there was not one problem. Hopefully we will be back next time"

955446,21536067,2014-10-19,13220153,Craig,"Sam was a fantastic host and did everything to make our stay as easy as possible. He accomodated last minute chenges of dates and a late check-out without the slightest fuss, and for a family with young kids, that was a huge bonus. 
This great apartment is also in a great area and a very short walk to all of the best things that downtown Toronto has to offer. We would recommend Sam unreservedly."
955446,24682973,2015-01-01,2919142,Kestutis,"We slept 5 full-grown guys in this space: 2 in bedroom, one on fouton, one on couch, one on a beefy aero-bed (provided by the unit).  Place is nice; great location.  This place is strictly a rental (i.e., no one lives here).  That's good (clean), but:  

* We were only provided 2 towels for 5 people
* No shampoo or shower soap (had to buy).
* No extra linens, covers, or pillows for guys on couch/aerobed.

Sam was nice (allowed us to check out late and sleep in), though not that great at keeping in touch.  I think he is pretty hands-off with the place."
955446,31679959,2015-05-08,32505542,Katherine,"Sam was very accommodating with a last-minute booking! He was helpful and his apartment was in great condition and in such an amazing location. The concierge in his building was SO helpful. I stayed at his place for a week and would return in a heartbeat if I ever return to Toronto! Bring your own soap, shampoo, and conditioner though :)"
955446,32361840,2015-05-17,17299278,Daniel,"Great location, within walking distance of everything. When we had trouble figuring out the AC, Sam responded instantly and helped us get everything figured out. Very approachable and responsive, would definitely stay here again!"

C était la première fois que je réservais avec Airbnb je ne suis pas déçue. J aurais aimé être reçue par le propriétaire que nous n avons pas vu ! 
Petit bémol malgré tout : la centrale électrique en face de l appartement qui génère un ronronnement constant.
A une autre fois peut être !"
955446,48357289,2015-09-25,7994877,Dylan,"Nice apartment that was as advertised. Good building in a good location. Sam was easy to communicate with, wouldn't hesitate to stay again."

955446,50569118,2015-10-12,45755308,Penny,This apartment is great!!! It is actually make u like u r at home. And it's only a 3-min-walk to CN tower and 10-min-walk to Chinatown. It is really comfortable as well.
955446,73211525,2016-05-07,65974538,Marvin,"I absolutely loved this condo. I came to toronto to attend a wedding and when I invited the groom over,he immediately said he would like to get ready for his wedding at Sam's condo because his condo was cramped and ours was spacious. Even the wedding photographer loved this condo. there was also a good view of the CN tower from the balcony.plus there is a gym ,sauna and pool in the building.i would definitely recommend stayin here."

955446,77055842,2016-05-30,26696805,Todd,"The listing was accurate and the apartment was very nice.  It is modern and comfortable, and you will not be disappointed.  The location is fantastic if you want to be in the center of all things Toronto.  You can walk almost anywhere you would want to go in Toronto from the apartment.  You need a key fob to get into the building and the common areas of the building so make sure it works.  Sam was available, easy to reach and helped when the key fob (battery) needed to be replaced and when we needed more towels.  I recommend this apartment and Sam."
955446,81787365,2016-06-25,21151176,Indumathi,The location was perfect and the apartment was lovely. Very secured parking facility. It was very convenient to move around with everything being within walking distance. All in all we had a great time and we will definitely return for another stay. :)

955446,98114641,2016-08-29,78710085,Joseph,"Stayed here for 3 nights and was perfect for me and my 4 friends. Clean, close to the CN tower, Rodgers Center and the ACC, also a TON of restaurants and nightlife. Sam was a great host and was available whenever we needed him. 5/5"

955446,102175079,2016-09-17,14666927,Liam,"We had a fabulous time in Toronto! Sam's condo was beautiful and had everything we could want. The condo's in the heart of Downtown so it's very close to many of Toronto's famous sites, and close to many lovely streets with great eateries, and also close to the subway. There was a very good supermarket on Peter's Street just 5 minutes walk from the condo. The concierge staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend Sam's place :-)"
955446,103933881,2016-09-25,33333548,Monica,"Enjoyed staying at Sam's place. Great location with in walking distance to CN tower, ACC, Roger's Center and other downtown attractions. There were some toiletries missing the first night that we arrived and Sam replenished the items the following day while we were out exploring the city. The building also has a good sized gym with lots of equipment and a nice roof top patio to hang out and enjoy some of the cities view."
955446,124716355,2017-01-02,37990020,Sara,"Both myself and my boyfriend had an amazing stay at Sam's condo! We stayed in Toronto at his place over the holidays for a little over a week, and we had no complaints! The location was amazing, as it is walking distance to great restaurants, excellent nightlife, and everything else that downtown Toronto has to offer. When we come back to Toronto, we will definitely be staying there again! Thanks so much Sam :) "

955446,238292477,2018-02-25,27879716,Christopher,"If you want a well located place that feels like a home away from home I cannot recommend this units highly enough.  5 minute walk to the subway, ten minutes from the Leafs game and plenty of restaurants!  There is even a Starbucks in the building!"

6140766,35270134,2015-06-16,10845677,Jean-Philippe,"Carol and Dan have been outstanding hosts! 
Dan offered a complete tour of the apartment and made sure we were comfortable. A big plus is the parking lot at back as paragon tends to be tricky in Toronto. The location is ideal! Close to restaurants, bars, and shops. Ideal for any young professional visiting the city. "
6140766,35888043,2015-06-22,36085748,Andrew,Carol and Daniel we're great hosts with a great spot in a great location. I highly recommend their listing to anyone looking for a nice stay in Toronto.
6140766,36574866,2015-06-29,33934396,Steve,Lovely pad true to its description with lots of space and in a lovely neighbourhood. Perfect for exploring on foot!
6140766,41277310,2015-08-05,21400560,Melissa,I LOVEDDDDDD how cozy this rental was. The hosts were amazing and easy to communicate with. It was perfectly centered and easy to commute to every place we were going. Thank you so much Dan!! 
6140766,43406756,2015-08-19,7988656,Robert,"Carol and Dan did everything to make us feel comfortable and were available in spite of our somewhat unpredictable needs. The place is lovely and lived-in, full of character and with everything we needed. The backyard is a nice addition, and the location can't be beat -- we didn't need a car once in our four day stay, and we had a blast.

I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere to stay."
6140766,46140234,2015-09-08,12508821,Robert,"Dan was very welcoming and gave us a lot of great advice regarding the neighborhood. The apartment is clean and spacious, with very comfortable beds . The neighborhood has  lots of great outdoor restaurants and coffee shops. It was great having parking spaces and the tree lined streets were wonderful!"
6140766,46642295,2015-09-12,2856994,Christina,"My parents and I enjoyed our stay. Upon our early arrival, we met Dan, he gave us a tour of the home and gave us some architectural history on the home, and gave us plenty suggestions to visit. he arrived many hours early, and the last guests had just checked-out; de allowed us to leave our bags and take a copy of the keys while he thoroughly tidy up the place.

The apartment is beautiful and is much more spacious than the photos illustrate. Both bedrooms are comfortable. I slept in the extra living/study room that had such a comfortable futon bed; there was additional comfort with an added tempurpedic padding. I enjoyed the large modern bathroom and the large fully stocked kitchen! Also, if you have a car, there is private parking for you in the back of the house. 

Dan made himself available when we had questions on where to purchase beer (note: Toronto has special retailers you'd have to purchase alcohol from).

The neighborhood is a gem. It was my first time in Toronto, and I'm glad I stayed where I did. There are plenty of great hip food and bar options. It's safe, and pretty local. Also, the streets cars stops are a short walking distance away and taxi's are easy to wave down.

Overall, I'm very happy with my booking and I would absolutely love to stay here again!
"
6140766,49926785,2015-10-07,16246537,Dirk,"We can highly recommend Carol's and Dan's apartment. It is exactly as described and a very spacious place. After being confronted with a canceled AirBnB booking Dan was so nice to come to our ""rescue"". Initially we booked an apartment downtown but we would always return to Dan's and Carol's place because Little Portugal is a very charming part of the town we otherwise might have never seen. And with the streetcar it is easy to access downtown. Most of the time we walked (ok, you have to walk for a few minutes but when the weather is nice its takes you along many nice shops, restaurants, bars etc.). ...lots to see. The area of the apartment offers all you need in close walking distance (e.g. grocery stores). Dan was very helpful and responsive when an issue with the plumbing and the washer popped up. If you're looking for a nice place to stay close to downtown: go for it."
6140766,50971708,2015-10-16,1636735,Susan,"Our host Dan met us at the door.  He took the time to label the bell with my name in order for me to gain access to the apartment.  The apartment was spotless.  The kitchen was well stocked.  Dan encouraged us to use any supplies needed. He pointed out the towels and cleaning supplies.  He showed us where the laundry was and let us know the yard was for our exclusive use.  He had made up the sofa bed as we needed it in addition to the master suite.
He provided us also with the internet code. Neighbourhood is awesome.  It is quiet, safe and has quirky shops.  It is well connected with transit to downtown."
6140766,51454066,2015-10-20,43733064,Hilton,"Dan was very welcoming, friendly and helpful.
The apartment was spacious and clean. Bathroom great, bedroom a good size, we love King size beds!
Location excellent. 
The entrance to the house where the apartment is located was musty  smelling and uninviting. Outside of windows could do with a good cleaning.
"
6140766,58745046,2016-01-04,3257402,Matt & Emily,"My husband and I were so happy to have stayed in Carol and Dan's apartment during our first trip to Toronto. They graciously accommodated us with short noticde. Not only was the apartment beautiful, spacious and comfortable, it was in the PERFECT location for exploring the city. There were countless wonderful restaurants, bars, coffee shops and boutiques within a short walk of the apartment (some of our favorites were Union restaurant and Jimmy's coffee) and it was a very easy bus or street car ride to other areas of Toronto. We would definitely stay in Carol and Dan's place again the next time we're in town. "
6140766,62646839,2016-02-15,53876385,Resha,"My friends and I got the lovely opportunity to stay at carols and dans place for the weekend. The house itself was really cute and neat, with everything accessible to you in hands reach. The neighbourhood was really nice as well you could pretty much walk to anywhere and explore the near by attractions and little shops. Dan was a wonderful host. My over all experience was a great one"
6140766,69002203,2016-04-08,2366204,Sean,Carol and Dan were great hosts. It's a nice spacious apartment in a good part of the West End. Would highly recommend.
6140766,71819598,2016-04-28,11545845,Erin,"We needed a place to stay in our neighbourhood while undergoing renovations to our home.  Carol and Dan were extremely responsive and the check in and check out process were both excellent.  We did not take advantage of their local knowledge (living in the area ourselves) but based on checking in, I'm sure they would be very helpful. The space was charming and quirky, nice to have a king sized bed, and the kitchen was well-equipped to meet our short-term needs.  Thanks Carol and Dan!"
6140766,72192759,2016-05-01,36867449,Marc,"We had a terrific stay at 194 Dovercourt. Dan was a great host, the apartment was comfortable and roomy. The neighborhood is great and we enjoyed the nearby restaurants located  very closeby. The parking spot also came in very handy. We hope to come back again. "
6140766,75985548,2016-05-24,18642695,Quentin,"Great place to visit the city, in a lively neighbourhood! The flat is much bigger than the photos suggest. It was a pleasure to spend a few days the, and the parking spot is very handy! Dan himself was very responsive and helpful. "
6140766,77424657,2016-05-31,2788711,Paul,"Overall we enjoyed our stay. Dan (and his cohorts) were very welcoming and informative. The apartment was spacious; the bedroom was comfortable and the bathroom newly renovated. The kitchen and living room were a little dated and could use some work. The area is fantastic; our daughter lives nearby and introduced us to the local hotspots, esp the Luna cafe, where we got our Americanos every morning. We would stay here again."
6140766,79478783,2016-06-13,50397620,Watershed,Duncan and Morgan had a great stay and loved the space. Also the neighbourhood was amazing! Everything was smooth and we will definitely be booking again for future trips. 
6140766,80971794,2016-06-20,44591784,Vikas,"Dan was awesome. Possibly the fastest confirmation in the history of Airbnb. I was left in a real jam, as my previous booking, which was accepted, flaked out and didn't get back to me. I'm in the middle of renovations and needed a place badly. 

Dan and Carol's place looked cool and is in a really nice part of downtown Toronto. 

The apartment was clean, and well designed. 

Beautiful old house. 

Nice bathroom!

King sized bed with comfy pillows. 

Dan stayed in touch to ensure I had everything I needed.

I highly recommend Dan and Carol's place. "
6140766,82469300,2016-06-27,53696797,Kale,"Dan met my son and I when we arrived, as was previously arranged. He took the time to explain the rental unit and all facilities. The space itself was plenty big for two people with full kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. Wonderful area of the city, central yet quiet at the same time. We had a great stay here."
6140766,83956939,2016-07-04,57161166,Christopher,"Our stay at Dan and Carol's was fantastic. Dan was very accommodating and met us as soon as we arrived in Toronto, helping us to get settled and giving us a tour of the home. He was quick to respond to any questions we had over the weekend. Many amenities were included in the house, including coffee, a dishwasher, fresh sheets and towels. We will definitely consider staying with them again if we are in the city."
6140766,87856870,2016-07-22,71688039,Thomas,The cats loved the duvet; we loved the neighbourhood. Great location. 
6140766,89031151,2016-07-26,83424499,Anh,Great location. Walkable to plenty of restaurants and shops. Convenient access to street car lines to get around the rest of the city. The apartment was charming and as described. 
6140766,90455745,2016-08-01,28340039,Andrew,"Dan and Carol's place is great - clean, roomy, comfortable. The neighborhood is really fun with good restaurants, bicycle friendly and safe. Dan is relaxed and helpful. We loved our stay here and would come back."
6140766,124741316,2017-01-02,2366204,Sean,"Dan and Carol were really great hosts: friendly, responsive and easy to  communicate with, and exceptionally generous in how they facilitated our specific needs and situation (our stay was a comparatively long one). The apartment is very comfortable and homey (it's got everything you'd need and lots of space), and it's located in a great part of the city, with Queen, Ossington and Dundas all less than 5 minutes walk away. In short, I can't recommend the apartment, or hosts, highly enough - a perfect spot to stay in West Downtown.

6140766,136098605,2017-03-08,33971950,Correy,Recommend! Place was big for two people and perfect for a stay in Toronto. Welcoming and answered any questions we had. 
6140766,147603423,2017-04-27,126625402,Henry,Great location and a really nice apartment for one or two people! Excellent kitchen.
6140766,151858004,2017-05-14,42924405,Beth,"The apartment was large and comfortable and in a perfect location to explore a very eclectic area of Toronto with interesting shops and wonderful restaurants.  The secure parking and being pet friendly was greatly appreciated.  Communication and check in and out were excellent.  We walked everywhere and felt part of the neighbourhood.
Thank you Carol and Dan."
6140766,155725947,2017-05-28,2184472,Jonathan,"This home was very comfortable and spacious for four guests, and the secondary bed was comfy too.  Dan greeted us upon arrival and showed us all of the amenities.  Kitchen is large and fully equipped for cooking.  Bathroom has been fully updated and has a nice shower.  This is an older home in a neighbourhood of homes that have ""history"" and many have been renovated; real ""character"" in the area.  One long block walk to a stretch of Ossington Street with numerous hip restaurants and pubs.  Street car and bus on Queen Street nearby for easy access to downtown.  A great one-week stay in a delightful area.  Thanks to our hosts!"
6140766,162177023,2017-06-19,40772912,Lucie,"Comfortable. clean and has everything you need.  Great location with onsite parking.  Quick bus ride to CN Tower, aquarium.  Great restaurants close by.  Check in was easy and Doug was very helpful and quick to answer all our questions.  If you are looking for a great, clean, comfortable place to stay that is centrally located then you will be very happy to stay at Carol's Place."
6140766,164790341,2017-06-29,1822499,Meredith,"Dan and Carol's place was great.  The location was perfect - very close to lots of fun restaurants, groceries, and shops and with easy access to public transportation.  We had a car with us but never really needed it.  It was also perfect for our toddler, since we were in walking distance to lots of playgrounds and parks.  It is an apartment, so the extra bedroom where she slept had a little noise from the neighbors above (footsteps, the occasional voice), but nothing out of the ordinary.  The main bedroom was completely quiet.  Comfortable, cozy, and lots of character.  We'd definitely return!"
6140766,166768928,2017-07-04,784127,John,This place was PERFECT.  It was in the best location full of shops and bars and restaurants.  Had we not stayed here we would have been in this neighborhood the entire trip.  Carol and Dan were attentive but respected privacy.  Best trip in a long time!
6140766,168937537,2017-07-10,129908993,David,"Dan et Carol sont très accueillants et très arrangeants (avons pu quitter les lieux plus tard que prévu). L'appartement est bien situé avec bus et tramway accessible à pied (5 à 10min). Il y a une place de parking qui est utile. Par contre, attention l'appartement est un peu bruyant avec les voisins."
6140766,172073498,2017-07-19,40212816,Alex,"-Easy check-in
-Great location
-Accomodating: they let us stash our bags there on the last day after checkout while we explored town more
-Beautiful home in a lovely neighborhood"
6140766,174014826,2017-07-24,126368520,Paul,"Dan and Carol’s apartment is large and well-stocked.  Both beds were very comfortable.  We loved the neighbourhood and location – close to many shops, restaurants, transit and a large park.  The secure parking spot was a welcome bonus.  Dan and Carol were very attentive and provided great recommendations for the area.  Dan met us in person to ensure we had everything we needed. We really enjoyed our stay – thanks Dan and Carol!"
6140766,174970439,2017-07-27,129025523,Rapha,Une très belle place! Près de tout et du quartier branché. Idéal pour jeune couple ou amies voulant venir séjourné et visiter. 
6140766,176327796,2017-07-30,45922285,Amanda,"Carol and Dan's place was so fantastic. The location was perfect, the bed was amazing, and everything exceeded my expectations!"
6140766,178488867,2017-08-05,116828769,Li,Very nice  we will booking next time. 
6140766,180917709,2017-08-11,28982551,Lisa,The area was fantastic. We particularly enjoyed Trinity Bellwood Park where we took our 4 year old pretty much every day during our stay. Dan and Carol were excellent in responding to any query we had.
6140766,182409372,2017-08-14,520273,Francis,"Perfect neighbourhood. Amazing spot in TO.
I got in the city unfortunately late and Dan was there, waiting for me. Super chill.
The flat is huge and clean.
I had a fantastic time!"
6140766,185047830,2017-08-20,50363043,Edwin,Great location. Off street parking was a plus. Awesome neighborhood. wpuld definitely stay again.
6140766,187724355,2017-08-27,137122840,Sharon,Dan was a great host! He was very helpful and the unit was in a great location. Definitely gonna stay there again. Thank you so much
6140766,190438677,2017-09-04,694238,Kerry,"We are vey happy we stayed at Dan and Carol's. Right from the start, they were cheerful and helpful in our communications and easy to reach at all times. Dan greeted us genially on our arriva,helped us with our bags, and gave us an extensive tour of the place with thorough  information about how everything  worked,checking to be sure the TV was set up properly, and left us a map of the area with all the high points and restaurants etc . We loved the huge and comfortable king-size bed with beside lamps for reading, There was lots of closet space, and lots of towels and hot water in the modern bathroom. It is a spacious apartment, bigger than we expected. I really enjoyed the large kitchen area and found it quite charming .There were many staples already supplied and lots of room in the fridge for our groceries. It was an excellent location for us, being on a residential street with large trees, but very close to the shops on Queen West.Dan had thoughtfully made up the bed in the cubby for our son and, best of all, left us TWO sets of keys, so we could each go our merry ways. He also very graciously let us leave our bags in the apartment to collect later, after we checked out, as our flight was  in the evening, A really great host.
You should be aware that, as Dan states in his description, it is an older home. I didn't notice any noise problem, but my husband found the footsteps and talking from the apt upstairs distracting, although they were not overly loud. It is really  nice that there is a backyard and barbecue with the apartment, but it does need a gardener's touch this year. All in all, we were very pleased wit our stay here and would be happy to rent here again."
6140766,192953941,2017-09-11,14340766,Erik,"Everything as described, super spacious apartment, awesome location, and really responsive host."
6140766,194024082,2017-09-15,133244261,Daniel,"We had a great time at Dan and Carol's place. Much larger than expected and in a fantastic neighbourhood with loads of brilliant bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Decor is really cool, hosts quick to respond to any queries. Highly recommended."
6140766,195220885,2017-09-18,144190046,Sharon,Excellent Airbnb! Dan was a great host. Very knowledgeable about the suite and the area. The parking spot was a terrific addition.
6140766,221710982,2017-12-27,10888538,Cynthia,"We had a very pleasant Christmas visit to Toronto, staying at Carol and Dan's place.  Dan met my husband on arrival and introduced him to the house and the apartment.  He provided sets of keys for both of us which was much appreciated.  The apartment is perfect for visiting this large city.  It is centrally located and within a short walk of bus and streetcar routes that connect to the subway system, so the apartment makes a good base for exploring the city.  For those with a car, there is a free parking space.  The apartment is also extremely spacious and the kitchen has every utensil and piece of cooking equipment you could ask for.  This makes it great for guests who are planning a longish stay and want to make most of their own meals.  There is also a den with a desk where we could set up our laptop.  It's also handy to have access to the laundry room.  Carol and Dan were super prompt in responding to any questions that we had during our stay."
6140766,223741923,2018-01-01,32005823,Jay,"Really lovely place, close to downtown. Friendly host."
6140766,236154617,2018-02-18,129039825,Dawn,"Great space in a wonderful location! The kitchen is a beautiful space and well stocked. The neighbourhood has many amenities that are walking distance - groceries, public transportation and a park, most notably. The hosts were very quick to respond to us whenever we needed them."
6140766,242217242,2018-03-11,163434841,Jaicha,This place is just as pictured. The bathroom was definitely my favorite part - so beautiful and clean. Then entire place was cozy and clean. Dan was nice enough to get us a newspaper with “things to do in Toronto”. Very nice and personable.
6140766,249703770,2018-04-02,171892018,Camille,"Nice old house with “vintage” look. Near nice shops and restaurants as well as park...Carol and Dan were really nice and responded quickly to any questions. 
Can hear the people living upstairs and heating a little noisy and warm. Found the house a little “dusty”"
6140766,259766774,2018-05-02,143924853,Guy,Great apartment and responsive hosts
6140766,261479154,2018-05-06,4413297,Christopher,Great place. High ceilings. Back yard with barbecue and parking. Amazing location in the best neighbourhood in Toronto. Can’t ask for much more.
6140766,264269806,2018-05-13,17010870,Dane,Had a great stay at Carol and Dan's spot. I always enjoy staying in this neighborhood and it was nice to stay in a large spot that even had a backyard! I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in Toronto.
6140766,268289140,2018-05-24,750638,Julia,"Carol & Dan's place could not have been more perfectly located--loved the neighborhood, and all the great restaurants, fun shops, and beautiful park within a ten minute walk (especially our favorite new breakfast place right across the street). The apartment was a spacious, clean, comfortable home base for our family's week in Toronto, and Carol and Dan were super-accommodating to us and our toddler."
6140766,270559001,2018-05-29,5307283,Maria,This is an ideal location to stay in Toronto.  There is a lot in walking distance and easy access to any place else.   A parking space was also a great bonus!  It was very comfortable and clean and very well supplied.  Don's intro and instructions were so helpful that we never needed to call!  He had already answered all questions.  I have no hesitations recommending this place.  
6140766,273008660,2018-06-04,1959347,Sean,"This was definitely one of the best AirBnBs we ever stayed at. The area was great with everything close by and easy access to downtown, huge place with everything we could need and some nice extras too. We'd definitely recommend it and stay again."
6140766,275685832,2018-06-11,67432765,Susan,"Carol and Dan’s apartment is spacious, well located and really clean. The photos show what you get and the location is close to public transportation. The parking on premises was a boon."
6140766,276736242,2018-06-14,19532207,Amy,"Carol was so, so accommodating with our last-minute request as our family rushed into town for the birth of our daughter. Although I didn’t stay at her place, the guests had only glowing things to say about the space and would certainly stay there again!"
6140766,278211163,2018-06-17,24370194,Rylee,Charming space and good location just outside of the downtown core. 
6140766,282557477,2018-06-27,1686684,David,"Beautiful space, centrally located it was easy to navigate anywhere in the city. great amenities. Easy communication."
6140766,288729834,2018-07-10,183152699,Ian,"I have nothing but positive things to say.  The list would be long, but here’s a couple of comments.

The neighbourhood is fantastic.  Bars and restaurants of all types, all within a 10 minute walk.  It’s an eclectic mix of traditional restaurants that do unbelievable breakfast pastries, and hip evening places that will make you a perfect cocktail.  The house is ideally placed close enough to the bars, but far enough that it’s on a quiet street.  
If that’s not enough, a three minute walk up to Queen will get you on the streetcar that’ll get you into the touristy part of Downtown in about 15 mins.  Or a longer pleasant walk South gets you to Liberty Village with its very upmarket vibe, and then through that to the Lakeshore.
Everyone is friendly, and helpful, and nothing is a problem for anyone.

Carol and Dan seem to be around.  But I didn’t see them much.  They answered all my questions, explained what I needed to know.  And left me undisturbed.  
I couldn’t figure out the television.  I sent a note, and Dan came and sorted it in minutes.  
All pretty faultless really.

I could go on...  If you can; stay there.  But don’t book it up when I want to go back next year :-)"
6140766,291801759,2018-07-16,172611725,Mario,"Very spacious and cozy apartment, a lot better than the pictures. Awsome neighbourhood with lots of restaurants and shops.
Carol's husband Dan was super nice showing us everything and answering all our questions. Carol even thought about a bed for our baby which we didn't expect from an Air BnB.
We really felt at home and fully revommend the place!"
6140766,305575178,2018-08-11,735599,Umberto,"Me and my wife were headed to Toronto for a week in august. It was Carnival weekend and middle of the summer so many places were booked. We found Carol's place to be in an ideal location and a great value.  Communication and booking went smooth and Carol checked on or prior to arrival.  Check-In also went smooth and we met Dan on our first day. He offered tips and also general information about the place.  We didn't get to meet Carol but we felt at home the whole time.  The place has an old charm with modern amenities. It was very spacious and stocked.  The bed was comfortable and the climate was perfect for the heatwave that was in Toronto at the time. The place is in a great area with restaurants, cafes and bars close by. Public transportation was also close so we were able to maneuver around Toronto easily. It was our first time in Toronto and Carol's place was an ideal place to stay. Great location, hospitality and a welcome feeling here. Thank you Carol and Dan. Our stay in Toronto was great!"
6140766,307511410,2018-08-14,206861617,James,Carol's place was more than we expected. Very clean. Great location with walking access to Queen street and numerous vegan dining options for my vegan daughter. I highly recommend it. 
6140766,315342654,2018-08-28,3839682,Sarah,"Fantastic location in a great area in Toronto! We've just returned from a lovely 2 week stay in this apartment as a family of four. Carol and Dan were quick to reply and answer questions from the start, and Dan was super helpful- dealing with our very delayed arrival, settling us in and giving us great local tips. The apartment itself is spacious and full of character and was lovely and cool during a very hot 2 weeks.  Generous supplies of towels/bedding and a fully equipped kitchen meant that every need was catered for. The apartment is on a lovely tree-lined street and it's just a short walk to Ossington and Queens West so you have great shops, cafes, restaurants and bars all close by.  Trinity Bellwoods park close by and then an excellent tram and bus service to get you downtown. We absolutely loved exploring Toronto and hanging out in this lovely neighbourhood, and  hope to come back again. Thanks again Carol and Dan!"
6140766,317079931,2018-09-01,162222901,Jodie,"Carol and Dan's apartment is a beautifully decorated, homely place which is not far from shops, restaurants and attractions. It is much nicer staying here rather than the busy downtown area of the city.
The communication between them and us was perfect and gave helpful tips on where to visit and eat. We could not fault the property nor Dan or Carol.
Thanks again for a lovely stay
Jodie and Sam"
6140766,318788081,2018-09-04,72956423,Megan,Great AirBnB!
6140766,336732890,2018-10-14,163441303,Jamila,"Dan was very responsive and attentive, a fantastic host.  The apartment is spacious and comfortable.  The bedroom is quiet and the king bed is awesome!  The bathroom is modern and stylish, with a great shower.  Internet is fast and reliable.  There is a supermarket, many shops and great restaurants within walking distance.  It's a short walk to bus/streetcar lines.  In our five weeks there we had a huge variety of attractions and activities to choose from.  Our favorites were Art Gallery of Ontario (free Wednesday nights), High Park (gardens and trails) and downtown's Harbourfront (from there is a short ferry ride to Toronto Islands)."
6140766,351953785,2018-11-24,1221434,Miguel,"Awesome location, very stylish, incredibly clean. This is the type of place you show someone that doesn’t do Airbnb to convert them. Next time I’m in Toronto I will definitely come back here."
8742410,50415897,2015-10-11,17206498,Fania,"The place was just as described, clean,beautiful and comfortable. Kamran was very responsive. There are plenty of shops, restaurants and grocery stores nearby. Downtown and other sites were very accessible. The only downside was that there was no parking spot in the building but there's plenty parking around. I would come back to Toronto and would stay with Kamran again! Thank you for everything!"
8742410,51204699,2015-10-18,20815340,Richard,"The place is in the best neighborhood- similar to being just off 5th Or Madison Ave in NYC or Rodeo Drive. In Beverly Hills. The best neighborhood in the city. Everything is close!
The unit is in perfect condition! It is brand new! It was the original Four Seasons Hotel Toronto that is being converted. There is some construction next door that you may hear in the morning, but you could be at the luxury hotel across the street and paying much more and still hear noise. Your host, Kam is very quick in responding to emails and is  a pleasure to arrange with. Loved the place!"
8742410,52886333,2015-11-02,14011502,Rebecca,"Kamran was such a helpful, communicative, fantastic host. I stayed in Kam's clean, perfectly appointed condo for almost three weeks, and he was always easily reachable if I had any questions. I strongly recommend staying at a Kam property."
8742410,59596042,2016-01-12,32458547,Patrick,"I live in Toronto but had to find a place to stay nearby to wait out the repairs in our condo because our water tank went bust. 

There are many places in this condo building on Airbnb but we choose Kamran's. Everything was new and clean in the condo as it's a new condo which is still being built.

The condo had everything you need for a short or long stay. If anything is missing Kamran will offer to get it to you (eg., dishwasher detergent, shower mat).  WIFI works wonderfully. Kitchen was had all necessary utensils, pots, pans, knives, kettle, and coffee maker. 

It's a great location with many amenities nearby - restaurants, shopping, movie theater, grocery stores, and public transit. 

There were a few minor negatives - noise from a new condo construction nearby, lingering paint smell in the condo, and slippery bathtub (we let Kamran know and he offered to bring over a non-slip mat). The construction noise is muted when the window is closed, but we had it open to air out the paint smell. Note that we initially booked 1 week but extended for another week so we were comfortable. 

All-in all we had a good host and comfortable place to stay. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a place in Toronto.  

Cheers,
Pat"
8742410,60981255,2016-01-30,53823726,Irene,"Beautiful aparment, fully equipped kitchen, excellent location in Yorkville, whit a lots of shopping and nice restaurants. Close to a subway station and a Whole Foods Market. 
"
8742410,62595670,2016-02-15,20480072,Gregory,"Kamran was a great host! He was always available when we had questions and his place was in great condition, exactly as listed! Thank you Kamran for a great stay. I would definitely recommend this listing! "
8742410,63120725,2016-02-20,41560067,Kathy,"Kamran made it very easy to gain access to his home, and was very reponsive to any questions we had. The pictures on Airbnb are very accurate. The internet was very good which was important as I worked a good part of the time I was there. The location was perfect for my stay. Thank you we would certainly rent from Kamran again."
8742410,65688617,2016-03-16,61566254,Brandon,"This was my first AIRBNB experience. I read all of Kamran reviews and felt like he would be the host to use. I can say that to a tee, Kamran is exactly as his reviews state. He communicates and responds at anytime you need. He is very helpful. The location and the unit itself could not have been better for my needs. The only unfortunate part and this is nothing to do with Kamran and very minimal is that the building is under renovation. During my stay which was a weekend. I did not hear anything happening during my stay. So again no big deal. I still give 5 stars for cleanliness, hospitality, and communication!"
8742410,95380929,2016-08-19,2526529,Amir,"It was a good stay and just want to summarized it:

Check in:
I was surprised, that Airbnb didn't give the provide ID to Kamran & I had to stay for 1 hour in the lobby after almost 25 hours traveling time, for the concierge to get a hold of Kamran and get his approval as the reservation was under my Username and Concierge wanted to verify my ID with Username from Airbnb.

Location:
The location was really good. I had stayed before in that area.

Building:
The building was under construction and from early Morning there were a lot of noise and actually I had to book other place for the rest of my stay

Basics
The Basic things like Soap, Tissue, were not available.

Cleanness:
The place was clean & nicely decorated."
8742410,99253879,2016-09-04,4529595,Jitse-Jan,"Communication with Kamran was smooth. He always replied fast to any message and was willing to help where needed. The studio has an excellent location with all interesting neighbourhoods on walking distance. Union Station is a 30 minute walk and the shopping streets are even closer by. The grocery store is only 2 minutes away. The place is perfect and has all the amenities that you need. Unfortunately they are constructing a new building next door, but the noise was not that disturbing. Of course you are in the centre of a big city so there will be some more noise in general. I will recommend this place to friends visiting Toronto."
8742410,124697079,2017-01-02,2458569,Hervé,"Excellent condo in an excellent location. Clean, comfortable and quiet. Check-in was super smooth with the building's concierge.

Parking was simple in nearby garage, although a bit pricey. We left the car there for the duration of our stay, as we were able to walk almost everywhere. Access to public transportation was also easy, there were several buses and subway stations nearby.

Would definitely recommend."
8742410,133944431,2017-02-25,100046167,Scarlet,"Kam was a really good host, helpful, friendly and warm-hearted. We'll definitely come back next time if possible. "

Fabulous as always."
13415314,151985914,2017-05-14,11122466,Holly,My boyfriend and I had a great stay here. The place was super clean and obviously newly renovated with everything we needed. It had a great location downtown Toronto close to all the main attractions and walkable to restaurants and bars. Perfect for a really convenient and relaxed weekend. Would highly recommend!  
13415314,152642511,2017-05-17,42214406,Grace,My stay at Pem's place was great. Pem was a wonderful host. She always responded very quickly and made sure that we had everything we needed to make our stay the best it could be. The place was perfect. Everything was very clean and comfortable.

13415314,164785568,2017-06-29,32479301,Kirk,"Great downtown location. After a day at wonderland we crashed and lined up activities downtown including a Jays game. 5m walk to transit / subway for anything higher up (Casa Loma, ROM) and 10m walk to Rogers Center/Ripleys / CN Tower. We didn't make use of the outdoor space due to time and weather but the amenities looked nice. Check in, access and communication were easy, easy and easy."

Very highly recommended! Thanks for a great stay. 100% would stay again. 
13415314,172679833,2017-07-21,30839635,Amanda,"Pamala's house is clean, comfortable and well-equipped. My family enjoyed our stay there. We walked all over Toronto. It's close to CN Tower, the aquarium, and tons of amazing vibrant neighborhoods and delicious restaurants. Top notch experience! "
13415314,173606515,2017-07-23,665991,Evan,Pamala's place was great.  Arrival was smooth and having a place to park in the building super convenient.  The building was great and modern. Residents seemed friendly. Location great. We tried a restaurant right at the base of the building and there is a 24-hr Tim Hortan's nearby. Hope to visit again someday.
13415314,174371243,2017-07-25,133993290,Martin,Le logement est situé dans une tour à condo. Il se situe à 5 minutes à pied de la tour du CN. Facile d'accès en voiture. Stationnement intérieur moyennant un extra de 15$ la nuit. 
13415314,174989638,2017-07-27,134427849,Leonid,"Beautiful modern apartment in the heart of Toronto, with gorgeous view from the balcony! We've walked everywhere. New  secured building. Dedicated parking spot is a huge plus. Very comfortable beds, with firm (but not too firm) mattresses, TV in every room. A word of caution though for light sleepers like myself: while one of the bedrooms is absolutely quiet, the second one is overlooking the railroad  with heavy trains passing by. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. Thank you, Pamala!"

13415314,182012209,2017-08-13,73381746,Ryan,"House is kept very clean.  Pamala was super easy to communicate with and always got back to me right away when I had questions. Even checked in with us to see how everything was and if we needed anything else. Wicked Host.

Went for some baseball games so the location was fantastic and there were a couple good restaurants right next to the building.

Very close to all the action downtown but not quite in the mix of it which was perfect and made for cheap uber/cab rides and nice walks.

Would definitely stay again!"
13415314,182885682,2017-08-15,135714894,Robert,"The condo was just as described and very clean.  It's walking distance to the ballpark, CN tower and Aquarium, as well as waterfront activities.  The kids loved the pool and the tv in their room.  It was great to have laundry in the room and a coffee maker for the morning!"

13415314,194818743,2017-09-17,8082897,Andre,"Loved the area- grocery store nearby, nice restaurant, lots of people(and dogs!), clean, etc. There was some noise from the trains nearby but did not prevent us from sleeping. We were about 15 to 20 minutes from the convention center( which is beside the CN Tower). We had trouble with the air conditioning as it seemed to only do one room. Perhaps leaving the bedroom doors open would have helped. Quick responses from Pamela. Not sure who was cleaning(cleaning lady or Pamela) but when we arrived to leave our luggage, she was not very friendly."
13415314,195978565,2017-09-21,58489982,McKenzie,"Great, easy, clean place to stay -- we only stayed one night but it was perfect for our needs."
13415314,196263751,2017-09-22,150871775,John,"Our stay at Pamala's condo was one of the highlights of the entire trip.  It was my first time using airbnb so I wasn't sure what to expect.  But immediately after booking it, Pamala reached out to discuss check-in details, and continued to update me as our time got closer, making sure I had all my questions answered.  It made for a smooth process and we had no problems at all.  The condo is lovely, and the location is amazing.  If I'm ever back in Toronto, I'm contacting Pamala first!"

13415314,198774147,2017-09-30,34662150,Kelly,"As advertised! Great base for exploration. It worked well for our family of four with kids 10 and 8. The AC only works in one bedroom, so if you’re hot by nature and it’s summertime, you might bring or ask for a fan :)"
13415314,201593428,2017-10-08,52156452,Matt,"Great location near Downtown Toronto.

Well-equipped condo with onsite gym and pool(!).

Parking and entry were a little bit complicated, but if you follow the instructions carefully you will have no problems. If you require parking, I recommend having a second person rather than trying to do it alone."
13415314,209901689,2017-11-06,153318445,Val,"This Condo is close to everything! It can sleep 6 comfortably and has everything you would need for a long stay or an over nite one! Peaceful and clean.

Her place was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay. The extras were the TVs and much needed after a day out touring around Toronto and coming back to relax.

The parking was great considering it’s hard to find parking in Toronto. We will be back!! Thanks for everything Pamala!"

If you have a car, the parking garage could be a bit confusing. We had some issues with the cleanliness of the bathroom but everything else seemed fine."
13415314,250595650,2018-04-05,54272714,Vinh,"As advertised.  Great location.  We enjoyed the pool which is a lap pool that gets busy at night with many people doing laps about one body length in between.  Easy and quick communication with Pamela.  The apartment is  about 500 or so square feet with two bedrooms and one bathroom connecting them so if you're traveling with family it's ok.  However, remembering to lock and unlock two doors for privacy can potentially be a problem.  The dryer takes forever so if you're planning on doing laundry be prepared for a lot of waiting."

There was plenty of room for the 4 of us. The location was very close to the Rogers Centre(you can see it from the end of the street) and the entertainment district. Parking is included with the rental and that is a huge plus. The apartment was thoroughly cleaned and well stocked with towels, extra bedding, soaps, etc. Pamela answered any questions we had immediately and provided great communication prior to our visit."
13415314,318373667,2018-09-03,112697801,Arron,"Pamela's place is a cool little gem in a great location in Toronto. I stayed with my brother during labor day and it was walking distance from many of the happenings downtown. Pamela allowed us to check in a little early which helped since we arrived early. I would recommend her place to anyone. One note: Don't forget your toiletries. It's only soap, shampoo and conditioner there. If you like small washclothes, bring them too. Only hand towels were available."

Pamala replied immediately to any questions we had. The apartment feels very secure and having that supermarket nearby is a real plus.  The restaurants and bars on the corner are also very nice.  The only complaint is the noise (from the building site and the trains!) which only really effects the front bedroom.  Would definitely stay again if back in Toronto. Thanks Pamala for the hospitality!"

since its self-check-in/ checkout you must prepare yourself as you have to use the fob to press the P2 parking but also must leave it on the counter, found it a little complicated. I  would recommend another self check out option.
But The experience was overall a 5-star rating!!! would recommend this spot to anyone."

The apartment looks and feels as described or better. I highly recommend it.
Thank you

14871622,106687078,2016-10-07,92537476,Ty,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights. We haven't used that many airbnbs, but this one was definitely our favourite by far. This was a great apartment; beautifully and comfortably furnished, quiet, and in one of Toronto's best neighbourhoods. It has all the modern amenities but with the orginal charm. 

The apartment has everything you could need, and more. Soaps, cleaning products, and even items you don't think you'll need until you need them (ziplock baggies, tupperware, etc.) Situated very close to transit, shopping, and nightlife; although you can sit out on the balcony and enjoy the street below just as well. 

Hyla and Leonard were extremely easy to communicate with and a pleasure to book with. They made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. 

If you ever need an airbnb while in Toronto again, there is no where else to look. Book here."

We hope to return!"
14871622,115677338,2016-11-26,21228691,Sam,"Hyla made me feel right at home from before I arrived at her beautiful apt. Hyla's communication is fantastic and prompt, and she herself is warm and welcoming! The apt is exactly what you see in the photos provided and the description on her profile. The location is right in the heart of Little Italy, Palmerston st is well lit and beautiful. It's only a 10 minute walk from College st which has everything you would need from cafes, bars, movie theatres and restaurants to convenience and clothing stores. I would absolutely recommend staying here if you're coming through Toronto!!"
14871622,124274598,2017-01-01,33270665,Claire,Hyla's flat is really lovely and well located. It was easy to find. Hyla answered all of our questions and was as helpful as one could hope. I would certainly recommend this flat to anyone.

14871622,156389497,2017-05-30,11240325,Jane,"
Hyla's flat is super clean, in a fab location and very tastefully decorated. I've done Airbnb in London, Paris, Athens, Copenhagen, Belgium & Reykjavik and I actually think this was the nicest one of them all. Thoughtful details like lots of towels, shower gel and shampoo, lovely wine glasses and hooks for coats. The keypad entry was convenient and simple and the location is fantastic - on a quiet tree-lined street between the Annex and Little Italy - perfect for exploring the city from. 
Hyla always responded to messages quickly and was on hand to help with anything we needed. 
We can't recommend this flat enough and I suspect we'll be back someday!"

"
14871622,160104916,2017-06-12,71565072,Moria,Hyla's place is so clean and spacious. We really enjoyed the neighborhood. There is a great espresso place around the corner and many restaurants within walking distance. The patio and balcony seats were great for hanging out and people watching. 
14871622,162392475,2017-06-20,70150828,Brian,"A suite so comfortable that you will forget that you have to eventually leave. We stayed over a long weekend in June.

Hyla is a great host. Knowledgeable of the area and available should anything come-up. 

The photos are accurate, this place is really nice. Clean, comfy, stylish and ac and extra fan should you need it. The suite is well appointed. Everything we needed was in the kitchen and the in-suite laundry- wow nice bonus.

Walkable to so many nice Toronto neighborhoods. The neighborhood and the neighbors are quiet. Never a concern having to walk anywhere. Uber drivers never seemed to be more than 3 min away.

This kind of quality is what Airbnb should be all about. On our next trip to the area we will book again. 

Thanks for a nice vacation stay.

14871622,180764101,2017-08-11,7461833,Lily,"We had a great stay at Hyla's place. It was super cute, comfortable and located on one of the best streets in Toronto. Complete with all of the amenities one could need. Hyla was very responsive and helpful. Would highly recommend it! "
14871622,182419558,2017-08-14,2144777,Rene,Nice clean apartment in a good neighbourhood.
14871622,183944517,2017-08-18,141322356,David,"Awesome place to stay, clean and comfortable. Not too far from down town by TTC or drive. Would stay here again and recommend to anyone."
14871622,185450006,2017-08-21,128793449,Aida,"Ms. Hyla is a wonderful host.  The home is beautiful and very close to Bloor Street, aka Little Korea, the subway, and College Street, aka. Little Italy.  I felt close to everything and the heart of the city but had the quiet of being at home.  Thank you, Hyla, for allowing us to stay in your lovely home!"
14871622,188202863,2017-08-28,141065474,Ruiying,"Hyla is a great host she answered our question patiently. The house is in a great location which is very quiet and is great for people who have a car. But if you don't have one, it is also close to the subway station and Korean town. We have a great time staying here and I really like the decoration of the room. It's so pretty."
14871622,194353130,2017-09-16,133171965,红,Great host and amazing place in one of the most. we plan to recommend it to all our friends visiting Toronto!
14871622,196558803,2017-09-23,704166,Constance,"We had the pleasant stay at Hyla's. The flat was clean, nice, with all the needed utilities to make us at home ! It is well-located in Toronto, the neighborhood is so nice too. We would definitely recommend this place to our friends and family."
14871622,202261626,2017-10-10,2721890,Anat,"We've stayed at this apartment for two weeks - It really exceeded our expectations. The apartment was super clean, the living room and bedroom were very comfortable. We've spent a lot of time in the living room so a spacious room was important to us (and it was).
The apartment is also located in one of my favorite spots in town.
All in all - very recommended."
14871622,248505388,2018-03-31,121572072,Dermot,"This is a lovely apartment in a perfect neighbourhood - close to lots of restaurants on Harbord, Bloor and College; and easy to jump on a bus, subway or trolleybus into the city centre. I lived there for six months through the Toronto winter - it would be even better in the Canadian spring/summer!"
14871622,262659057,2018-05-09,170848976,Carin,"Hyla's place is soothingly light-filled and spotlessly clean. The location is great – one of Toronto's prettiest residential streets, and very central, a short walk to the subway and right on a bus line. There is a deep soaking tub, of which I made good use after tromping all over the city. The eat-in kitchen is well equipped. There's a small convenience store two blocks away and lots of other food options just a little farther. The bed is *very* comfortable. Guests might want to bring slippers and robe for transitional-season visits, after/before heating season when it's still quite chilly at night. Hyla was readily available by text when I had a question about the washer/dryer in the unit (a major convenience). I didn't ask for local tips since I used to live in this neighbourhood, but I'm sure Hyla would be happy to provide them. All in all a great choice in this part of TO."
14871622,265844893,2018-05-18,21730656,Petra,"I had a very comfortable stay during my time in Toronto and Hyla was very quick to reply to my queries. The flat is located on a lovely residential road within easy walking distance to the shops of Little Italy and Koreatown. There's a large Metro supermarket within 15 minutes walk and good transport links close by. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in and I slept like a log. The kitchen is well stocked with utensils and cooking ware. One slight niggle was the lack of TV. Although there was one in the house, it was not connected to a working service and there was only YouTube or Netfkix (if you have an account) on offer. The walls between the flat above/next door are very thin, which was an issue for me as I am sensitive to noise. Apart from that this is a great flat."
14871622,272532941,2018-06-03,7602799,David,A great apartment in Little Italy with good links in to the main city. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Excellent bathroom and kitchen with everything one needs. Bed was very comfortable. It is in a quiet road in the same house as the owner but the flat is completely separate on the first floor. There are several internal steps up to the entry door. It has air conditioning when required in the bedroom and lounge. We used the aircon in the lounge only when nights were hot. We would look forward to returning.
14871622,276054400,2018-06-12,109880704,Anders,"The apartment is practically and tastefully furnished, and the kitchen is well equipped. The place has everything you could ask for.  We appreciated in particular the Nespresso machine, since we love a good coffee to start the day :)

On our arrival, everything was clean and in perfect order, and gave a professional impression.

As someone mentioned, there is no traditional television, but the big screen in the living room  supports screen-mirroring, so we were able to cast streamed tv from our tablet/phone to it.

The neighbourhood is very quite, and there are plenty of restaurants just a few minutes away by foot. No problems finding a parking place on the street, you just need to get a permit which was $25 for a week.

In addition, Hyla is super-responsive, welcoming and extremely helpful. If we ever go to Toronto another time, we would definitely stay here again. 100% Recommended! 
"
14871622,279071163,2018-06-19,107312036,David,"Beautiful pad, in a beautiful neighborhood at the heart of Toronto's hip scene. Hyla's place is well kept and very stylish and clean, but we often found ourselves using it as a quick basecamp for the gorgeous neighborhood, the local cuisine and regional to-dos that were all walking distance away. We saw the taste of Italy festival and enjoyed fine dining there once the street was open again. A 5-10min walk and we were at Kensington Market seeing everything it has to offer or deep into Chinatown, getting potsticker dumplings. It's on all of the right public transit lines and after a long day of seeing the town (it only took a few minutes to get anywhere), Hyla's place was the perfect cozy, hip spot to unwind and relax."
14871622,282149800,2018-06-26,4348642,Tara,"Very comfortable and stylish apartment in a great location in Toronto. The neighbourhood is both very local and neighbourly but also very central, with easy walking access to Kensington market, Little Italy and Bloordale village. Also very close to U of T. You can also walk to the ROM and the AGO. The apartment was very well equipped but not at all cluttered. There are window air conditioners for very hot Toronto nights.  Hyla is a very nice and easy going host who takes good care of the apartment. Highly recommended."
14871622,286583487,2018-07-06,71837483,Phil,"If you want a great host with a comfortable dwelling that's located near everything you need, look no further!  This is the place!"
14871622,288767090,2018-07-10,82282025,Kevin,"Nice clean, comfortable  apartment in great location. Walking distance to restaurants, near Little Italy section.  Easy and quick communication with owner.  Apartment is well appointed. Netflix TV but not regular stations. Street parking available with easy to get permit.   Overall, a very nice  experience."
14871622,292637429,2018-07-18,22338683,Zenna,"Hyla’s place is in a great location- it’s a lovely neighbourhood and close to both subways and streetcars. The apartment itself is clean, spacious and has some great outdoor space. The apartment has lots of ammenities. Check in was simple and communication with Hyla was excellent. "
14871622,311636818,2018-08-21,16182489,Sylvain,"L'appartement est très bien situé pour visiter la ville, transports publics à proximité, plusieurs commerces et restaurants à quelques minutes de marchés. Hyla est une hôte disponible et attentive. L'appartement est propre, confortable et bien équipé. Le quartier est verdoyant avec de belles maisons anciennes. Très bon choix.

14871622,322638431,2018-09-13,187941401,Kairas,"We were looking for a well appointed apartment near the university in downtown Toronto.  Hyla's place in Palmerston Blvd was just what we needed. Roomy, well furnished, with all amenities in a quiet but very central neighbourhood. Hyla was super responsive. Hope to be back again."
14871622,327901906,2018-09-24,13143495,Peter,"This is a stylish and comfortable apartment in Little Italy, in a very pleasant tree lined street.  It is a ten minute walk from Bathurst subway station, and there are shops and cafes  on Harbord and on Bloor Streets."
14871622,328968901,2018-09-27,6509991,Mark,"Great location and a great space. There was some construction while I was there and Hyla was on it right away. She was very responsive and left feeling well cared for and she was great at communicating and supporting my need for quiet for work.
Would definitely stay here again!"
14871622,333578470,2018-10-07,148314,Annie,"Very Nice appartment, very well equiped and decorated 
Great location !
Hyla was always available for any question"
14871622,342882060,2018-10-29,7307273,Andrea,"Hyla's apartment is beautiful and incredibly well located. She was extremely easy to communicate with and helpful. The street the apartment is on is beautiful and calm, and we were able to walk to a number of restaurants, cafes and cute stores in the area. We would love to stay there again!"
14871622,344451882,2018-11-03,219756313,Carmen,"El alojamiento de Hyla es muy bueno. Se cuenta con todas las comodidades , muy limpio además de una ubicación muy buena , que facilita un desplazamiento sin complicaciones ."
14871622,360756823,2018-12-21,9959693,Lynn,"Hyla’s apartment is very well located, close to public transportation, restaurants and shops. The apartment is small but perfect for a single person or couple.  The bed is very comfortable and there are nice quality linens and towels.  There is also a good amount of storage.  The kitchen is pretty well supplied with IKEA everything. The bathroom is very small but clean and new.  Hyla is a super host for a reason.  She responds immediately to any problems or queries.  She was always kind.

The one caveat I would have is that noise, between units, was a problem for me.  The apartment  is below the host’s home and the sound of heavy footfalls, children and barking dogs was intermittently disturbing and disruptive.  That said, I would still recommend Hyla’s as a good spot for a short term stay in a great neighbourhood."
14871622,366358063,2019-01-02,28313111,Sherry,Really great location and such a cozy apartment. Really made our stay very comfortable. Lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance.
14871622,410075902,2019-02-09,24877648,Rodrigo,The best place in Toronto! close to everything and the best your hosts !! I recommend this place 100% !!
14871622,415055527,2019-02-21,3609904,David,Great first impression upon entering the unit that remained throughout my stay. Palmerston Blvd is one of the most beautiful neighbourhood streets in the entire city and the apartment perfectly complimented the street narrative. The floor plan was top shelf. It is a well appointed and very comfortable. The kitchen is huge and the living space never felt cramped. Hyla seems to be a traveller herself and knows intuitively what travellers want (the Nespresso machine was a nice touch). Would return in a heartbeat!
14871622,417834185,2019-02-28,27203975,James,"Hyla was very responsive and friendly in her communication. The apartment was exactly as advertised. Wonderful location squeezed between the annex and little Italy. I recommend this apartment. Thanks, Hyla!"
14871622,419729152,2019-03-04,231605984,Tomasz,"The flat is quite spacious and nicely furnished. Overall I had a good stay. The only problem is that the flat is a bit noisy - one can really hear the neighbours upstairs. However, it was always quiet during the night, so it wasn't a major issue."
14948026,104455049,2016-09-26,37055998,Ariana,"Our host, Nick, was out of town the weekend my friend and I stayed at this listing, so he made sure his friend Margaret (who was awesome btw), kept in contact with us to make sure we were okay and comfortable. That being said, despite having Margaret to communicate with directly, Nick also left a very detailed note with everything we could possibly inquire about (I.e. Wifi, amenities, etc). His condo was beautiful. Even more beautiful than the pictures listed here and it is located in the perfect location -- close to all of the major sites and a 7 minute cab ride from anything else you'd want to see in Toronto. Everything was very clean, and the views from the balcony and the glass living room window on the twenty something floor were to die for. I would absolutely go back to Nick's place the next time I visit Toronto. Thank you so much for letting us stay at your place -- hope to come back soon! 
"
14948026,104785043,2016-09-28,62933866,Shalyse,"Hey Nick, 
Your place was absolutely amazing! The location is perfect, and the view from the balcony is spectacular- the waterfront looked beautiful. The place is spotless, and is fully equipped with everything that you may need, every detail is considered, and each room is fully stocked with necessities and more. This Airbnb really goes above and beyond I was so impressed! Would definitely stay here again. "
14948026,105652292,2016-10-02,93963844,Erin,Our trip to Toronto was wonderful! The condo is beautiful and beside the water and close walking distance to all important and entertaining places. Nick and Margaret were both very helpful and communicated with us perfectly. We really enjoyed our stay and will hopefully be back again some other time!

If you feel like cooking everything is there. It definitely felt like home. Thank you Nick for your space!! Thank you Margaret to welcome us on our arrival!!"
16131824,121886693,2016-12-19,22134511,Tyler,A good value for the location. The apartment was fine but the building was currently under renovation therefore only two elevators for the building were in service and the lobby was always unlocked (door broken).

Nice boutiques right outside along the same street. City view is amazing. Clean and cozy and all around a great experience.  Definitely recommend this place if your visiting Toronto. 
16131824,138397871,2017-03-19,24594568,Kate,"Overall a quick & easy stay for a trip to TO. The Yorkville location is central & ideal, however do be aware that parking can get pricey (it’s a a short distance away from the rental, but still some effort to lug things up!). Anton was a great host, providing clear instructions for check-in/check-out & fair enough at responding to any queries. The apartment itself is clean, spacious & the bed was super comfy. Don't hesitate to book if you're looking for a no-fuss stay in the area. "

16131824,164274321,2017-06-26,30776588,Helene,Great location! Great place and amazing view. We enjoyed every day. Anton and his wife were quick to respond to every need- even making a special trip to bring extra towels. Lovely!
16131824,165686112,2017-07-01,5719868,Diyet,A great apartment. True to the photos. Anton and Ella were great hosts. They respond to questions in seconds and gave excellent instructions for the building. The apartment was lovely and the beds super cozy. Fantastic neighbourhood for dining and getting a nice glass of wine. 
16131824,166459193,2017-07-03,23907542,Betty,Very cute apt in a charming neighborhood with great restaurants & shops & close to transportation. Comfortable beds & very nice bathrooms. Very clean & true to pictures. Sofas are uncomfortable for TV watching but otherwise very nice & great views.
16131824,167684326,2017-07-07,23077966,David,Had a wonderful stay at Anton's place.  It's charming and in the perfectly central location in Yorkville.  It was a great home base for the 5 of us.  Anton was responsive and is consummate Airbnb host.  We'd highly recommend.  Thank you!
16131824,173055103,2017-07-22,116991347,Eddie,The place is nicely decorated and super clean. Anton is a great host and he acted immediately when we needed to fix the TV. Location is amazing although they have some construction happening next to the building entrance which makes it a bit difficult to drop off the car cow valet. The only concern is the valet parking staff who aren't up to the expectation and need training.
16131824,179460354,2017-08-07,129949024,Robert,"Anton was a great host!  Very through with the instructions and communication throughout our stay.

16131824,229028565,2018-01-21,167787373,Connor,We found it very difficult at your location to even move around the apartment. The walls are super thin and while we were loud it was as if we were waking around with someone waiting to complain. You couldn’t drop a penny in the apartment without a complaint. It was ok for everything else
16131824,232666642,2018-02-05,143050886,Kyra,"Loved the view at night. Unfortunately the unit had a strong odour of smoke, other than that it was great I'd definitely recommend Anton's place."
16131824,235157790,2018-02-15,94534302,Daniel,"El departamento está en un lugar ideal. Las camas y los muebles son de buena calidad y han sido elegidos con buen gusto. El lavarropas y el secarropas funcionan muy bien y la vajilla que proveen se ve reluciente. Los baños, bien y nuevos. También hay algunas aristas a corregir. Tuvimos un par de problemas que si bien se resolvieron rápido (platos en el lavavajillas sin lavar, la cafetera con el filtro y el café de los anteriores ocupantes, wifi que dejó de funcionar el primer día) fueron molestos. Antón -o el grupo de personas que responden siempre por Antón y gerencia el departamento, no me queda claro- responden rápido y mandan gente a arreglar lo que deba hacerse. Pero él o ellos no parecen supervisar personalmente el departamento y creo que eso se nota en pequeños detalles (por ejemplo, problemas en la pileta de un baño para que el agua drene). En general diría que el departamento está muy bien y permite una muy buena estadía pero que necesita, a mi juicio, un host que además de eficiente esté más presente en forma directa."
16131824,235696652,2018-02-17,57941835,Kurt,Extremely stylish space and great speedy responses. Would do this again!
16131824,236866026,2018-02-20,25413425,Michael,"The condo is completely as advertised.  It is new, right on Yorkville Ave corner Avenue Road.  STK is literally downstairs.  The area is wonderful if you are looking to shop and eat.

The space is new and in good order.  It was very comfortable for our party of 4 (2 kids/2 adults).  Building is great, they had a reliable valet and the check in/check out was automated and worked as expected.  The gym was also convenient.

Our (sole) issue is that room wasn't ready on check in at 3pm.  We had even messaged ahead that we were arriving soon, and we're told they ""weren't quite done"" but actually didn't start until 4.15pm, after we arrived and called a few times.  The response was great but in the end, only having use of our room 2hrs later than check in ruined our evening because we had been travelling all day and we all needed to shower before a party at 6pm which was 45min away.  We were given a token refund after complaining, but really it didn't compensate for ruining our evening.

If you stay here, call or message way ahead, I would say around 1pm, to be sure the room is cleaned, if you need it close to check in time."
16131824,237325926,2018-02-22,32496046,Mackenzie,"Anton's condo was exactly as advertised! Beautiful view of the city, convenient location and fantastic amenities. The place was spotless and comfortable -- I felt right at home. The check-in was so easy and every question I had was answered almost immediately. Can't wait to go back!"
16131824,237884144,2018-02-24,26072708,Billy,"Anton was an excellent host. He responded to our questions in a timely manner and was always friendly and helpful.
The only critique (which was discussed with Anton ) is the second bedroom off the kitchen had a glass wall not allowing for privacy. Installing night blinds would solve the problem. Other than that the condo is beautiful and located in the heart of Yorkville."
16131824,239666028,2018-03-02,77974212,Alison,"Anton went above and beyond with following up to check in during our stay, even though it was not needed, because all was well. It was clean and stylish with comfy beds. The only thing some guests may wish to keep in mind is the second bedroom does not have windows so it was a little stuffy. Otherwise, excellent!"
16131824,244476628,2018-03-18,64339870,Dave,Great location in the heart of Yorkville. Close to Whole Foods and lots of fabulous restaurants. Great view from apartment north on Avenue Road
16131824,258716284,2018-04-29,2987111,Ezra,"We were in Toronto for the weekend, for a day trip to Niagara Falls. For such a long stay the location and the apartment were perfect. Anton was a fantastic host."
16131824,262971060,2018-05-10,154790415,Holly,"Beautiful apartment, very clean and stylist. Close to amazing shopping. 
Thank you  Anton for a wonderful stay on our short trip to Toronto."

16131824,294088581,2018-07-21,27113968,Helene,"This place is in such a great location in the heart of yorkville, with so many great restaurants and shopping right outside the door. The apartment building is very nice and felt very safe and quiet. Anton was always very quick to respond if we had any questions at all.  The automated check  in and out was quick and easy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking to stay in the heart of yorkville. "
16131824,294970275,2018-07-22,159456632,Alexandra,"Anton is an amazing host, quick responses easy check in and check out make the time spent getting settled in as stress free as possible. The condo is so comfortable, the couches and beds  & the decor provide a really nice modern feel. It is also in a prime location within Toronto. 100% recommend this condo if you are looking for a nice place to stay in the city. I will say that it was a bit dusty but other than that the stay was fantastic."

16131824,331434616,2018-10-02,12535436,Gabrielle,"My boss and I traveled to Toronto for business and stayed at Anton's, the place is ideally located, the appartement was clean and we each had our own bedroom and bathroom, however you need to know that one of the bedroom isn't completely closed (glass walls), overall very positive experience, Anton is very responsive and available I totally recommend it!"
16131824,334319502,2018-10-08,153981071,Ervin,Great space and wonderful host.
16131824,338441941,2018-10-19,41148726,Nicola,Great little apartment in the perfect location. Couldn’t have suited us better. Thank you.
16131824,341342048,2018-10-26,14469323,Brian,Anton is very attentive to your needs. He was very quick to address any questions. The check in and check out process was seamless. The location is lovely. It is a bright well kept unit. The traffic is a bit noisy as it is close to a busy thoroughfare.
16131824,342265323,2018-10-28,110445112,Kyla,"Modern, bright and spacious condo in a great location. Perfect getaway in the city!"
16131824,344396399,2018-11-03,136020985,Yumi,This is really good located and clean space. But sofa bed is a little small. Host gave response whenever I send message.

16131824,347605469,2018-11-11,58213147,Bryan,Anton’s place was amazing - super location and the condo was bright and sparking clean. Anton was also a great host with lots of tips and helpful ideas. Would definitely stay here again.

16131824,354108409,2018-11-30,68128963,Philmon,Amazing space in great location. Hosts were very hospitable. Great stay!
16131824,359367899,2018-12-16,230392289,Edmund,Overall good experience. Condo was a little scuffed/beat up but horrible communication upon checkin. Was forced to wait outside the door with luggage for 30 minutes until a customer service rep let us in. Host didn’t respond
16131824,360155199,2018-12-19,181087331,Jennifer,"Great space, great location! Anton was extremely responsive."
16131824,369429762,2019-01-10,221194498,Karen,It's a nice place to stay at and was pretty convenient in terms of accessing the city. There was however a weird smell that lingered for most of our stay.
16131824,402469398,2019-01-18,44258368,Sikandar,Awesome location and a great place to stay

17682585,138008529,2017-03-18,54843379,Aleem,"David had an incredibly seamless check in and check out process, which was nice as it was completely hassle-free. The place was very clean, and the room was nice and tidy. More importantly, this is a great location, only walking distance from Bathurst station. Would definitely stay again!"
17682585,138602297,2017-03-20,92736335,Jayralin,"I loved this cozy little room!  It was a nice place to stay, we loved our time there.  It faces the back of the house so there's very little noise heard & conveniently right next to the bathroom.  Great location next to everything!  Just be aware if you need WiFi that it is not so great at this place, it would go out a lot but it is useful for simple web browsing.  All in all, I recommend!"
17682585,139082371,2017-03-23,1640472,Carmen,"Beautiful spot amidst a rather varied neighborhood :) Highly recommend his place for travlersof any kind, very close to transit and very clean!  "
17682585,140363096,2017-03-29,119610130,Roy,"Really enjoyed my stay in this cosy room. It's all clean and quite. And all the hotspots in town are just a walk away. Only the wifi isn't strong in this room. It went on and off. I had to do some work, and had to do it in the living room because of that. "
17682585,140956976,2017-04-01,31729165,Jiahui,"The location is great, you can walk to the subway station and also walk to Korean town to find something delicious to eat. The house is also great and accurate according to the describtion."
17682585,141311716,2017-04-02,38671025,Wei,"The room is very nice and clean. David is very friendly, and he provides very clear and sufficient information for check-in. I would like to stay at this place again if I go to Toronto next time."
17682585,142547819,2017-04-08,46749747,Paulo,Amazing host! Zero Complain in all aspects.
17682585,142823081,2017-04-09,34091502,Holly,"Really noisy, no parking available close to house and bathroom had no toilet paper"
17682585,143848561,2017-04-13,81970643,Tom,"The lounge area and kitchen were welcoming and very clean. The location of the house is perfect for travelers who prefer to walk places, even with any number of bus and tram stops near by, and the best of the city is never more than a 30 minute walk away.

The room was very clean and warm, with plenty of storage space. We were warned (via previous reviews) that the wifi connection in the rooms wasn't going to be great even on the second floor, and we heard from other guests that it was almost non existent on the third. The only really disappointing part of the stay was the bed itself, which was very hard and uncomfortable.

With all this in mind, this is a pleasant venue for a few nights' stay."
17682585,144106281,2017-04-14,125659637,John,"Perfect clean room, great for 1 person or couple. Many cool places to walk to nearby. Communication from start to end from the owners was excellent. Thanks again guys!"
17682585,146704150,2017-04-23,33745711,Mila,Nice stay! 
17682585,147807422,2017-04-28,110614700,Lee & My,"Great stay at David's! bumped into him once throughout my stay, appreciated my independence. Room was clean and accurate. First thing you notice is that the house is spotless! amazing job david, thank you for having me. Will stay again soon!"
17682585,149299081,2017-05-03,64076199,Pedro,"The check-in process was very easy. I was worried as I was quite late but it is 'automated' in a way that no one needs to be there to receive you. David always sent communications to check-in and out on time.

The place was very clean, quiet and the location is not far from downtown Toronto (within walking distance)."
17682585,150856217,2017-05-09,89601476,Carter,"David's place acted as a fantastic home base throughout my trip. The check-in and check-out process was seamless thanks to David's detailed instructions.

THE GOOD STUFF
The room itself, as well as the building, was very clean and well put together. Whether you're coming alone, or with a group, I'd highly recommend David's place for their professionalism, the cleanliness of the space, and the convenient location. 

THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF
There really wasn't much to complain about, other than minors things like.. the spottiness of the wifi, the lack of salt and pepper in the kitchen, the single blow drier in a four floor home. Like I said, minor stuff!"
17682585,152669196,2017-05-17,99218818,Marcio,"Close to transportation, calm and clean. But it could have a place to leave the bags on the check out for those who have to wait a few hours before the flight.   "
17682585,153762116,2017-05-21,95050421,Adela,"Wow ! Where do I begin !
All I can say is that this room was excellent , very clean, comfortble and my favourite part was the decor, it was so tasteful. Our host was fenomenal very informative and super helpful. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants the best of the best. Thank you ! Hope to come back soon :) "
17682585,155204317,2017-05-27,129052738,Agus,"Super recomendable, esta bien ubicada, super limpia y agradable!
Lo unico negativo es la cantidad de ruidos de las otras habitaciones en la mañana."
17682585,155725328,2017-05-28,125252821,Paige,Davids place was in a good location and the room was very clean. Check in and check in process were easy and David was prompt.
17682585,156686172,2017-05-31,5094200,Karla A.,"David's place is really comfortable, very clean and organized, and very pretty. I've stayed a couple times there and enjoyed it every time. 
David and Oscar are really attentive and will respond to whatever doubt you have, they're great hosts. 
The place is really close to zones of Toronto that I would highly recommend like Little Italy, Kensington Market and Chinatown. 
Definitely a great place to stay in. 
"
17682585,156903127,2017-06-01,121859934,Els,"It's a nice, clean place. Room is a bit small,  but there are bigger common area's. Washrooms were very nice. Bed was a bit short though die us Dutch people :p "
17682585,158220725,2017-06-05,34373881,Carina,"Nice and clean place with a nice little room. Just the matress is really hard ;). Big kitchen but just some basic equipment for cooking missing. Self checkin and communication worked perfect. Closeby public transportation via metro, tram and rental bike. "
17682585,158610934,2017-06-07,82700707,Mary,"Great area, around little korea, little Italy, and public transport
Relatively small space kept very clean
Although the room is marked as having free parking there are only two parking spaces for a house full of guests and spots are not guaranteed "
17682585,160321982,2017-06-13,32699330,Sanjay,"Our room was clean, small but comfortable, and the common areas were nice. The neighborhood is quiet and the location is somewhat central and walkable to many local restaurants and attractions. That said, we had a number of issues with our stay including very dirty bathrooms, paper thin walls which make it easy to be disturbed and to inadvertently disturb other guests, draconian house rules enforced by many rudely worded signs, uncomfortably hot temperature at night, a total lack of host presence down to a third party messaging us though airbnb and yet another person doing the daily cleaning of the house. We never met David, never interacted with him in anyway even through messaging and were given no explanation of why he was never on site, why we were being contacted by a third party through airbnb and why yet another person was doing the daily cleaning of the house. The cost was relatively low, however, for the location, so despite a less than ideal stay, if you're on a budget and have a high tolerance for the issues described, this may be a good place to stay."
17682585,162134536,2017-06-19,50331691,Emilie,"Great communication, good room, great location."
17682585,163097087,2017-06-23,42873051,Paula,"Quiet, central. Easy communication with host. The bed was very firm, which worked for me. Thin walls. "
17682585,165396699,2017-07-01,46500255,Karlee,"Excellent place to stay - clean, easy to navigate / good response time from the host. Would definitely recommend "
17682585,167424862,2017-07-06,100408252,Bruno Et Nathalie,"Ce Airbnb vient d'Être remis à neuf, il est très agréable mais il est loin du principe du RBN, car aucun échange entre clients et hôtes... les clefs sont remises dans des cadenas... l'entretien semble correct mais sommaire pour la salle de bains... et il n'y a que deux places de parkings à l'arrière pour 7 logements. Concernant les parkings publics, on ne peut laisser la voiture toute la journée devant car il y a des périodes interdites aux stationnements et le parking de la ville couvre des périodes de 7 à 18h et 18h à 7h ce qui veut dire qu'il faut se lever à 6h30..."
17682585,167684701,2017-07-07,20401522,Katia,My stay at David's place was great. Very nice house and great location. The check in was very smooth.
17682585,168530388,2017-07-09,136355414,Umarie-Pier,We liked that place. It was near of a lot of services. David and Nicole answered very quickly about any questions. We recommand that place.
17682585,168920999,2017-07-10,60604842,Laura,Great stay! Loved the location and the room was just adorable! The house itself had a wonderful decor too. The self-checkin and check-out is a huge plus for autonomous travellers. I am definatley coming back! :)
17682585,170109247,2017-07-14,29553594,Dan,"Decent place to use as a base when exploring the city. A bit over what you would normal get in a hostel. 

The matrace are great !!!"
17682585,170475295,2017-07-15,138585420,Helen,"Great location, close to everything. Very clear and nice house to stay."
17682585,171437277,2017-07-17,95308525,Amira,I loved the place. Nice clean ans cozy room. Great big kitchen. Clean and newly renovated bathroom. We only stayed one night but it was awesome! I definitely recommend it.
17682585,171765757,2017-07-18,10226481,Panayotis & Valia,"David's rooms are clean and modern. It's more like a small hostel rather than a home stay. You'll probably never meet your host, but receive instructions on  your email instead. For some this is good. For others, who are used to a little bit more hospitality, may seem weird. 
Our stay was nice and comfortable. We only faced one problem with the wifi, which (due to the fact that we could only communicate via email or the app and, well, we didn't have wifi to do it and it was very late in the night) was solved the next morning. However this was not something serious and probably not something that happens usually. 
Overall a good stay, a little bit overpriced for a room with shared bathroom, but accommodation in Toronto is expensive anyway. "
17682585,173055341,2017-07-22,61853606,Megan,"Our stay at David's place was perfect. Couldn't have asked for more.
Clean, walk-able to the hip part of town, easy check in.
Be advised- the 2 parking spots were not available to us at any point, they were taken by the same 2 cars the entire time and parking in Toronto is horrid. Worse then living in NYC. Dont count on them being available."
17682585,173617954,2017-07-23,95781238,Hugo,"Great place, just like the pictures. Easy communication, highly recommand this place! "
17682585,174024556,2017-07-24,93687692,Higino,"O quarto é pequeno, não tem sinal de wifi e o colchão é  muito duro.
Não existe ninguém para o check in.
O quarto é silencioso e fica numa zona com muitos transportes.
Acesso fácil ao aeroporto."
17682585,177116710,2017-08-01,9017411,Danielle,"Nice location near Bloor street with lots of restaurants, bars, etc. The room was very clean. Exactly as advertised. Would recommend!"
17682585,185000696,2017-08-20,29890211,Meghan,"Our stay was great, good location and easy self-check in. A huge perk was the free parking on a first come, first serve basis. Only issues was the bed was pretty hard."
17682585,190592953,2017-09-04,22478818,Laila,"If you're looking for a clean bed in a central location this is probably the right place. 
But it's nothing more than that. Unfortunately we were a really disappointed with the accuracy of the information given to us by the host. We were told there are two parking spots- which is accurate, but what we weren't told is that it's two parking spots for potentially over 20 guests since the house can host a lot of people. We were also told there's parking on the street but we weren't told there is a 3 hour limit. We were told they would check the parking situation prior to our arrival and they never got back to us.

Additionally the wifi in the house was practically useless, so you can't rely on that either.

Unfortunately parking and wifi were extremely important for us during our stay, and were not delivered"
17682585,190945366,2017-09-05,103100649,Enrico,"Very nice share house, clean, walking distance to subway and city centre. Fast and easy check in/out."
17682585,191464515,2017-09-07,149318523,Natasha,Awesome. Just as the picture looked. On point. Lovely stay
17682585,193708470,2017-09-14,2411934,Ina,"Nice spot. At first, it wasn't well-equipped but the host was extremely responsive."
17682585,194008231,2017-09-15,58460817,Magda,"Wir waren nur eine Nacht da und haben auch sehr kurzfristig gebucht, es war alles perfekt was Kommunikation und Check-In angeht. Das Zimmer sieht genau so aus wie auf dem Bild und das Haus ist sehr sauber! 
 Flüstern wird empfohlen weil die Wände so dünn sind und man alles hören kann. Auf dem Flur sowie im Zimmer.
Da wir nur zu Fuß gegangen sind und die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel nicht genutzt haben war es uns etwas zu weit von der City. Aber sonst eine gute Lage! 
Mein Tipp:
Das Badezimmer wird auch von anderen Gästen genutzt, vielleicht sollte man sich Desinfektionsmittel einpacken, wenn man wert auf Hygiene legt. 
Sonst eine tolle Unterkunft!"
17682585,195237098,2017-09-18,54748259,Dulce,"El colchón de la habitación es muy rígido, no apto para quienes acostumbran a dormir en camas suaves, el internet no llega a la habitación y en las áreas de estar falla muchísimo. 
La zona es buena para elegir transporte público y es segura."
17682585,195736259,2017-09-20,88256539,Lin,Like a hotel. 
17682585,198770914,2017-09-30,150968076,Dominic,"Beds were hard, and wifi was hard to use, but the place was nice, clean, in the middle of everything, and cozy"
17682585,200209087,2017-10-04,13335282,Kaku,Very clean and tidy.
17682585,201549076,2017-10-08,58610431,Regina Youjin,Check-in and check-out were very convenient! Its 5-10 minute walk from bathurst station and college st. The house is shared with other guests!
17682585,202717445,2017-10-12,52525395,Claire,"Super séjour, super logements !"
17682585,202977195,2017-10-13,30332115,Raphaelle,"The communciation was great with the people of PaperBox Mgnt. Even if I didn't meet anybody, everything for very well indicated. The room is very clean and the emplacement is great. Only negatives points are that the shared bathroom is as clean as a shared bathroom can be :) and that the walls are thin."
17682585,204747987,2017-10-19,152843118,Ilaria,La casa e la camera erano molto carine. Il bagno non sempre pulitissimo e la cucina un po' sprovvista di utensili (non c'erano scodelle grandi né scolapasta). A 45 minuti piedi dalla CN Tower e  5 minuti dalla metro. Praticamente nessun congatto con l'host.
17682585,205257277,2017-10-21,154747658,Raquel,"Localização ótima 
Quarto limpo 
Cozinha bem equipada e limpa
Gostei muito"
17682585,206699288,2017-10-26,58097352,Tara,"Exactly what someone would want/need as a young couple looking for a quick and easy spot to get to and from. Comfortable bed, and our room was ideal - was back of house with window out to fire escape, so our view was greenery and free of traffic sounds. Check in/out was a breeze! Thanks again. :)"
17682585,208254866,2017-10-31,142713996,Aristeo,Great place! Excellent check in process! Super clean! I would definitely stay in again! Best place for a short trip!
17682585,209151459,2017-11-04,31786571,Barbara,Quiet and cosy room in a perfect location. I really enjoyed staying in Toronto and this was the perfect place to live the city. The room was nice and clean and even the shared bathroom was fine.
17682585,210138749,2017-11-07,131178732,Anna,"Big house, reasonable location, nice bathrooms. But, bed was a bit hard! Useful having a parking space, but difficult to guarantee you'll get it as there are a lot of other guests in the house with you"
17682585,211314296,2017-11-12,49845371,Godfrey,"Great place, great location. But during a sunday morning had people going in and out of the washroom blow drying their hair and it was really loud for over an hour. At 6:00 am in the morning ! 

But overall great location on Bathurst street, easy to communicate."
17682585,212375639,2017-11-17,26358484,Munesu,"Shared bathroom was often messy and not cleaned thoroughly or regularly. The house is run much like a hostel. Host was inaccessible (no response to calls or emails during my 5 day stay), except for a gentleman occasionally on site who did not speak much English and barged into my room twice because he mixed up my check out dates. Self check in would have been seamless had the front door not gotten stuck, no one was available to assist. Room itself was very clean, and as shown in photo. All in all, okay for the price."
17682585,213361098,2017-11-20,61135436,Hugh,"We didn't get to stay in the room after all, due to some plans being changed.
But we appreciate the great communication with the host!"
17682585,213873507,2017-11-23,154127371,Moe,This place was comfortable to stay. I recommend this!
17682585,217918408,2017-12-10,56555733,Buqu,This place is very clean and modern. The check in procedure is also very convenient. I enjoyed my stay very much!
17682585,219743612,2017-12-18,27415572,Jake,"Stay was spoiled by a usurious lockout fee. $50! More than the cost of one night’s stay. And, as the management said, ‘It happens all the time.’ Management (located far away) took three hours to arrive with the key. A good rule for good business is not to punish people inordinately for innocent mistakes. The entire process here is automated and impersonal - perfect for sociopathic loners and people who enjoy hearing the toilet flush all night. If that describes you, stay here!"
17682585,219913418,2017-12-19,24164603,Lucas,"Amazing room, very quiet and comfy. The house itself is excellent too. I only had a problem with the WiFi at first, but someone assisted me, and the problem was fixed shortly."
17682585,220076678,2017-12-20,87296164,Joannah,"Such a lovely place, very stylish. Kind of like the classiest youth hostel. All guests share bathroom and large kitchen."
17682585,222704567,2017-12-30,31455093,Belinda,"I totally recommend this place, so close to subway, clean, spacious, downtown all that’s good! Thanks guys!"
17682585,223067656,2017-12-31,82121693,Yan Lin,The host replied very quickly. This place is affordable and convenient. There are many stairs so folks with big suitcases prepare yourself mentally.
17682585,227012048,2018-01-13,139736653,Alan,Super clean and safe. Great communication. Great location too. Super close to subway line.
17682585,228020056,2018-01-17,149753829,Rawa,It was exactly the same as shown in the pictures. Very clean and quiet. Close to nightlife. With a reasonable price.
17682585,228591942,2018-01-20,166191646,Gianluca,Value for money. Clear instruction to check-in. Clean place. Quick response
17682585,228951945,2018-01-21,17053857,Andrea,"Great space, everything was very clean and comfy. Check-in and check-out were very easy and the location was great. The hosts are hard to reach and a bit impersonal, but we had no issues so it was fine.  We would stay here again."
17682585,229773952,2018-01-25,27367757,Nikeeta,This place is a great economical stay. With privacy and an option to meet other guest. The room are designed nicely. For the value it is great.
17682585,230912473,2018-01-29,56125375,Ayami,ﾄﾛﾝﾄに滞在する際にはここを利用しています｡3回泊まりました｡ｼｽﾃﾑも立地も清潔さもGoodです｡
17682585,231501223,2018-02-01,89954317,Bhagyasri,Best location!!! Steps away to Kensington market and lot of restaurants. Good for a couple for a short stay.
17682585,234013056,2018-02-11,107173163,Izzy,Very organised check in/our system!
17682585,234425913,2018-02-12,75971171,Yu-Chun,"The room provided was nice and clean, in a fairly quiet neighborhood. 2 Parking spots were offered, and it is first come first served basis. If you happened to miss the parking chance I would strongly recommend NOT to park on the street. Im from US, and the rules and signs are just very different. I ended up gotten my car towed and ticked.. but other than that everything else was good.  The host was great to work with.  Easy check-in and check-out process. Instructions were clear. Would stay again if I come back."
17682585,236882514,2018-02-20,108257945,Ségolène,Emplacement proche du centre ville et très agréable ! Je recommande !
17682585,239188889,2018-02-28,69063074,Amrit,Professionally management. Slow internet only issue. Good location otherwise!!
17682585,239655723,2018-03-02,66931626,Marie-Ève,"Mon amie et moi avons eu un excellent séjour. Le logement était propre, silencieux et situé dans un beau quartier près de plusieurs petits cafés."

17682585,241294462,2018-03-08,130585545,Luiza,Great accommodation! Very clean and organized! Exactly how it shows on the picture!
17682585,241513740,2018-03-09,52899701,Yanny,"非常棒的住宿,很靠近公共交通,地铁站步行可达｡"
17682585,242230683,2018-03-11,71325909,Sarah,I have stayed with PaperBox many times and typically try to stay with them whenever I go to Toronto. PaperBox offers great rooms at a great value. It can be a little loud because there are so many rooms but I typically travel with a white noise machine that helps with some of the noise. Overall a great place to stay in a good location with easy check in and value.
17682585,243120451,2018-03-14,97111712,Billy,Great place to stay in Toronto!
17682585,243298561,2018-03-15,66383409,Sam,"Good place to stay in Toronto. Super easy to get to from Union Station and the airport, great location with lots going on nearby, the room and bathroom were clean, and it was simple to check in. The walls are pretty thin so you may hear other guests going in and out late at night."
17682585,244327008,2018-03-18,174818995,Charlotte Kwan Ting,"It’s basically everything you see from the photo. Hosts are very nice and communications were great. This budget friendly place is very close to everything, the location of this place is good. One disadvantage is that the heat is central-controlled so the room could be a bit stuffy sometimes. After all, I have enjoyed my stay here!"
17682585,246480992,2018-03-25,136960948,Jeffrey,"Had a great stay of 7 days; room was clean and the common facilities were clean and well appointed. Would not necessarily recommend if you plan on spending all of your time in the unit because the common spaces are shared between a number of rooms, but as for a launching pad to see the city or travel for business, it would be ideal."
17682585,248484559,2018-03-31,6609574,Cody,"This is a great guest house for travelers on the go, who're looking for a convenient, user-friendly base from which to explore Toronto. Check-in was super easy, the facilities were updated and very nice, and the location can't be beat! In fact, that was my favorite part -- it's awesomely located near major commercial districts and multiple public transit lines. Oh, and the price is totally reasonable."
17682585,252166130,2018-04-09,93103466,Louis,"Good stay for one night, unfortunately parking spots were already taken so I had to pay to park! Otherwise nothing wrong with the place it is calm and cosy!"
17682585,252660555,2018-04-11,61311979,Rahmina,Easy check in . Lots of things around the neighbourhood
17682585,253474425,2018-04-14,1838867,Eliza,"Sadly I wasn’t able to actually stay, as I got a migraine just before my drive up from Buffalo.  Mgmt was extremely quick with thorough responses though & helped with everything."
17682585,254664467,2018-04-17,128662296,Chenyang,"It is a not bad place but the wifi speed is too slow, sometimes can not even be connected."

17682585,256346001,2018-04-22,101388739,Maynor,"The room is smaller than it appears and is mostly furnished with plastic IKEA items. However, it's a great location, the bed was comfortable,  and check in instructions were made clear."
17682585,257022487,2018-04-24,55988414,Javier,The place is centrally located and close to restaurants and the city’s main attractions. This place is clean and cozy but I’ll recommended it only for a short stay.
17682585,257285865,2018-04-25,108761099,Stephen,A comfortable and stylish place to stay in a great old neighborhood. Completely updated and renovated. I have stayed here many times and will again.

17682585,261592999,2018-05-06,1217578,Sabrina,"This place is amazing! The check-in was super easy, the room and the house in general were fantastic and I can't stress out enough how clean the place was! It looked like you could eat off the floor! Great location also. I definitely recommend it!"
17682585,264235043,2018-05-13,115977091,Gabriel,"Très bien situé et très propre. Il s'agit d'une maison typique de Toronto dont toutes les chambres sont en location. Les instructions pour accéder à sa chambre sont claires et simples. C'est une expérience complètement impersonnel, je n'ai parlé à personne lors du séjour. Excellent choix si c'est seulement pour dormir comme c'était le cas pour moi."
17682585,265316225,2018-05-16,36435680,Cristina,"This place It's in a great position, between Bloor st W. and Queen St W. Clean and easy for chek in!"

- Nice location next to metro station
- Clean room 
- Very quiet

Cons:
- The bed was hard as a rock"
17682585,271871199,2018-06-02,11055572,Kristy,Comfortable stay and convenient location. Quick reply from the landlords. Good accommodation for the price.

17682585,279068765,2018-06-19,192009035,Marius,"We were very satisfied with our stay.  The appartment was overally clean and stylish. Being a need-freak I noticed little  cleanliness exceptions like the dusty air ventilation. But all in all it is a place to feel at home in a great neighbourhood, close to charming little Italy and the University."
17682585,280571259,2018-06-23,1243509,Peggy,This location is by Little Korea. Great location to the subway and there is a trolley on Bathhurst. Lots of places to eat. Neighborhood friendly. Take your own washcloth. Bed was firm and not supportive fo my back. It is clean. All hardwood floors and neat. You need to take your own coffee and tea. They have all the kitchen supplies. Good stay.
17682585,281754995,2018-06-25,188475660,Trish,"Nice place, great location, very clean and check in and out was a breeze!"
17682585,282507801,2018-06-27,20631652,Jerry,"Clean. Really clean. The location is decent. Plenty of shops and restaurants around. 
One problem is the WiFi is not working 50% of the time and the other 50% of the time the speed is not usable. That means you can really work if you are on a business trip."
17682585,287721375,2018-07-08,73681766,Jen,Looked exactly like the pictures! Great value and super easy check in!
17682585,289124455,2018-07-11,19802892,Éric,This is a great little place. It’s essentially a guest house with rooms without an onsite host. Big common areas and kitchen as well as good quality rooms and bathrooms. Perfect for the value. They were quite responsive too.
17682585,289977846,2018-07-13,87622582,Soyeon,"Close, walkable distance from Bathurst station."

17682585,292654635,2018-07-18,17004342,Frederieke,"The location is excellent for discovering the city. However, since this is a professional Airbnb house it is also quite impersonal (no locals/owners living there, only other guests you might run across). "
17682585,293560966,2018-07-20,154290278,Gakou,"Très bon logement niveau qualité prix et surtout très calme, l'emplacement est super pour une grande ville comme Toronto. "

17682585,295928243,2018-07-24,18946547,Adam,"Great spot. Easy check in, convenient location. Would highly recommend. "

17682585,299245371,2018-07-30,101134856,莉,"The room is fine,located at downtown, facing to the university of Toronto.  I shared the washroom with other 2 or 3 rooms,and washroom is just on my left side ,I can hear every one when they use it,can't sleep at all …"

It is a shared space, for us that was fine as we spent very little time in the air bnb besides to sleep "

17682585,308495468,2018-08-16,101849155,Brandon,"The location of the place is certainly the best part. Within 1 square mile you can walk to some of the best bars, restaurants, shopping places Toronto has to offer. The street car is right outside too. Parking however will be your constant worst nightmare if you are driving, the times are confusing, its expensive, and they will ticket you without mercy for even a minute over. We and another guest got towed in the same morning because we didn't understand a certain symbol on the sign. There are two spots in the alleyway for the airbnb, however any of the other 20 guest who are lucky enough to get a spot will likely park their car for their whole stay, leaving you to fend for yourself.  "
17682585,310418796,2018-08-19,60908025,Stella,Walls are really thin so you can hear everything that happens outside your private room. But regardless it was nice and cozy!

17682585,312987206,2018-08-24,194823085,Marc Vaughn,"Living in Toronto for the past 6 years has given the idea of how loud certain locations are. However, PaperBox Mgnt location was quite the shock because of how quiet the area was! Dave and his team communicated courteously and they presented excellent response times, as if I was texting to my own friends. Also, they detailedly explained how to get into the house. I definitely recommend their location. I look forward booking again with them!

17682585,328913512,2018-09-27,133890244,Motoki,"Clean and well-managed. But I think the team don’t take the coordination between the staff very well. A serious trouble could have happened because of that. 
The location was great."

17682585,347054024,2018-11-10,4429593,Adam,Fine place. Careful with leaving your shoes downstairs. Mine were taken from the hallway and hidden in an attempt to steal them.

17682585,351118926,2018-11-21,52838277,Doma,"I only used this place to crash at night, didn’t use kitchen facilities. Looked like the linens weren’t washed. Found several strands of hair in my bedding & pillows when I got it around 9pm, after a long day I had no energy to find a new place. People were in & out till like 1am & using bathroom which was right next to my room so I could hear everything. Yesterday morning I was woken up about 4am, someone was ringing the doorbell nonstop for about 30 minutes. No idea what was going on as it’s a keyless door. Wi-Fi was very spotty, ended up using my data. You can find a lot cheaper place and good value for the money elsewhere. It was very disappointing stay."

17682585,355752711,2018-12-05,23391922,Sally,"Place was clean and tidy and exactly as photos showed. Perfect for one person and a short stay with great location. I agree with other reviews that the bed is really hard but I didn't mind it - found it comfy!

The only downside was that noise travels REALLY well in the house. You can hear every door open and close and people walking around. Again, not a huge deal for a short stay. 

Overall I was happy and would definitely stay in this house again!"
17682585,356275076,2018-12-07,226428705,Julien,"- Very clean, updated space at a great value

17682585,358202986,2018-12-13,105011690,Martin,Nice and cosy apartment. Whole place was super clean and prepared accurately. You'll get exactly what you see on the pictures. However the bed was too hard to us and room temperature was too high so we had to open the window regularly to make it lower.

17682585,367354841,2019-01-04,232653195,Banu,"Great location and very clean, but the mattress was too hard and the bed makes a noise"
17682585,368701962,2019-01-07,125369531,Ross,"First off the check in process is VERY simple and straight forward . 

Location of this Property is very nice , pizza nova , Krispy Kreme , convenience store and more within a few steps 


Some more quick notes : 

- very clean property 
- bedroom was nice and looked clean 
- mattress is VERY thin and I wasn’t the most comfortable on it , seemed like a “prison” mattress
- the unit was VERY hot for me , thermostat was at 24degress C 
- kitchen is nice ! , bathroom was nice ! Especially the soaps provided 
- great space for the price , would just change the temperature issue and mattress 

Some more info on the property: 

This is a house that has been bought (assumption ) and has been transformed into a “ Airbnb rental space “ (assumption ) it is divided into multiple different “ units “ (rooms ) - the first floor is your living area , 1 unit and your shared kitchen , second floor is I believe 3-4 units with a shared bathroom (bathroom is very nice ) , and there’s a 3rd floor but I did not go up there so cannot say what’s on that floor. 

There are security cameras pointed facing the front door entrance when you walk in , kitchen , up stairs hallway ( again this is just what I saw there could be more ) 

Kitchen is nice with plenty of room to cook , fridge and freezer are spacious as well 


Overall was nice place to stay for the price 100% - what made it unpleasant was the hot temperature ( wasn’t able to sleep without waking up in hot sweats ) & the mattress certainly wasn’t helping in that department either ! 

OH ... and wasn’t as straight forward as they describe to park ... ended up parking on the street !"

17682585,402469567,2019-01-18,220014328,Samantha,"great location, stylist living room, upgraded washrooms but missing basic kitchen essentials such as a can opener, regular size drinking glasses, functional ice cube tray, blender"
17682585,403325373,2019-01-20,8131255,Michelle,"The house was very clean and tidy, especially considering the number of rooms and number of people in the place.  The self-check-in process was very clearly explained in the messages sent by the company beforehand, and check in was smooth.  The pictures online reflected the place clearly and accurately.   I found the room to be comfortable and met our needs, and the bathroom was large and very clean. There is a small living room and large kitchen available for all the guests. It definitely felt like a nice hostel with all private rooms vs. an Airbnb in someone's house. 

My only issue was the temperature in the room - it was a very cold winter day, and the second floor, where our room was located was WAY too hot.  I usually like warm homes, but this was too much.  We looked around for a thermostat and there was one behind a locked box and it read 24C which is a bit hot for indoors, but the room definitely felt warmer than 24C.  In our room, the vent was blasting heat.  I heard a few people in the halls comment on the temperature.  My theory is that people were opening up windows in their rooms which was throwing off the thermostat and making the furnace blast heat even more.  I immediately messaged the ""host"" (the company running the place) and they replied very quickly that they would message the actual host about the issue.  The temperature didn't seem to get turned down so I ended up opening the window up (in the dead of winter) to sleep comfortably with only a thin blanket.  The next day I received a message from the company saying the thermostat was set to that temperature ""for the comfort of the whole house"".   I feel like they could save a lot of money on heat and make a lot of people more comfortable by just turning down the temperature so that we don't have to open all the windows!  This also highlights the issue of having a company run the Airbnb, so that there is a level of management between you and the people who are in the house, running the house, ie. what you normally think of as ""hosts""."

They responded to my questions quickly. The only thing I would say was slightly disappointing was the cleanliness of the bedsheets/pillows/blankets. I understand you can’t wash it after each stay especially if it’s busy but mine had makeup and food steins. But overall i definitely recommend this place and would stay here again!"

Her communication was fantastic and she was very accommodating of any requests. I had told Kristen I was surprising my girlfriend with a trip to Toronto for her birthday, and Kristen was more than happy to help with the surprise and added some thoughtful touches to the condo for our stay. I definitely recommend this condo and will be certain to to reach out to Kristen again for our next stay in Toronto. Thanks Kristen!"

We had a great time relaxing, navigating, and exploring the downtown Toronto within our time frame because everything we wanted to visit was easy to find.

It is located right in the heart of the city (only 5-7 min walk to the Convention Centre, ACC, Rogers Centre, CN Tower, Rec Room, etc). Not only was the place well-kept but Kristen also went above and beyond as a host. She responded very quickly (only a text or call away) and addressed any and all questions that we had.  She was very knowledgable of the area and offered additional information (maps, apps for parking, etc). Her hospitality and kindness was very much appreciated! We will most definitely return to Kristen's place in the future :)"

Her apartment is clean, airy, quiet, beautifully decorated and in a great location.  We tried two of her suggestions for local restaurants and they were spot on. Like everywhere else in Toronto, there is construction going on next door, but you really can't hear it - those windows are very well insulated.  Everything we needed was there and so convenient we will definitely go back."

She was so accommodating and even let us keep our bags there until the next guest arrived, so we could explore the city easily. Her place is gorgeous and clean, with a cool view of the Roger’s Centre. I will definitely keep her place in mind the next time I’m in Toronto. It’s less than a 10 minute walk to the Roger’s Centre/CN Tower, and a block from the Air Canada Center. Perfect location if you’re going to a game or concert. We loved Kristen and will miss her, even though we’ve never met her in person..."

Condo was immaculately clean, has comfortable furnishings, wifi, and an amazing view of Toronto! We ended each of our evenings on the patio looking at the Toronto skyline and relaxing on her out door furniture. Incredible location as we walked to everything. Grocery store right across the street called Longos. Kristen researched parking locations and gave advise on how it works because we flew into Buffalo and drove to Toronto. Really no need for a car as you can walk or Lyft to all places. Kristen’s communication is first class. We will plan another trip to Toronto and will not stay anywhere else.

We were able to prepare a traditional Christmas dinner as comfortably there as in our own home.  This unit is compact with all the convenient necessities.  The building itself is located in the center of downtown with 'walking distance'  attractions and convenient shopping on every side AND, the price is completely reasonable!
Kristen herself was attentive in the sense that she texted us useful information and made herself available if necessary.   I definitely recommend Kristen's place and actually intend to revisit in the future.   Thumbs up on all counts...thanks Kristen's and all the best!"
19565789,363415552,2018-12-28,167696969,Christy,Kristen was best host anyone can ask for.

21701951,223604496,2018-01-01,83945407,Briana,"Kevin’s place is a great place to stay for a couple nights in the city. A quick drive to all the local bars and shops, but an amazing view. The patio was a great spot to see the city as well as the water. The space was open and was very well maintained. Kevin is very easy to communicate with, anytime I had a question he answered right away which was amazing. Front desk employees are a little rude but other than that we enjoyed ourselves."

21701951,231494599,2018-02-01,32935998,Melissa,"We chose Kevin’s place because it is only a few minutes from Billy Bishop Airport. While the space is technically as described, the photos are misleading. It is an outdated and worn space, which wasn’t a problem for us. Just a heads up.
Our biggest issue was that the condo was very dirty. There was dirt and crumbs all over the floor, the shower was grimy, the counters were sticky and the toilets didn’t look like they’ve been cleaned in a long time. 
We found the building to feel very secure and was quiet throughout the night. Very few amenities provided. Ie towels, hand soap, etc. 
For $250/night we had higher expectations. Would not recommend overall."
21701951,231934293,2018-02-03,65759193,Matisse,Beautiful place to stay. Kevin was always quick to answer any questions and made sure everything was always good! Will definitely be booking again !

Kevin’s place is super stylish and so well located! It was absolutely spotless and and everything was ready for our arrival, even the makings for coffee and tea which was appreciated.

The bedroom however felt like we were snuck into someone’s room. There were clothes shoved to one side of the closet and belongings and sheets stuffed under the bed as well as the bathroom sink. There was also no body wash left in the container so more attention could have been paid to the upkeep of the bathroom. However, Shane was very hospitable and easy going!"

The check in instructions were very easy to follow. If only one recommendation, would be that the mattress is a little too firm... maybe just for my taste but I am putting it out there. 
It was a good experience."
